We begin by examining three key challenges: bias, complexity and intellectual debt. Each of these challenges impacts solution deployment, maintenance and interpretability. 

We emphasise that while model development is an important part of the pipeline, focussing only on model accuracy can cause us to overlook real-world deployment challenges.
