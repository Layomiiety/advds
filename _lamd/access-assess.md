\notes{**The check Session for this Practical is 7th November 2024.**}

\notes{- This practical should prepare you for the course assessment. Ensure that you have a solid understanding of the material, with particular emphasis on the AWS database setup. You should be able to use the same database that you set up here for the final assessment.
- In that assessment, you will work with datasets that require initial setup processes. **Start your work on dataset access and database setup early** to avoid being blocked from work on subsequent stages later.
- Some tasks will require you to develop skills for searching for multiple solutions and experimenting with different approaches, which lecture content may not cover. This environment closely resembles real-world data science and software engineering challenges, where there might not be a unique correct solution.}
