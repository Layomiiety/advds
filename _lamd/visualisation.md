abstract: | 
  This lecture covers approaches to data visualization and
  dimensionality reduction, focusing on techniques like PCA, MDS and
  manifold learning. We explore both theoretical foundations and
  practical applications, from basic linear methods to advanced
  manifold learning approaches.
