title: "The Challenges of Data Science"
venue: "LT2, William Gates Building"
abstract: "<p>In the first lecture, we laid out the underpinning phenomena that give us the landscape of data science. In this lecture we unpick the challenges that landscape presents us with. The material gives you context for why data science is very different from standard software engineering, and how data science problems need to be approached including the many different aspects that need to be considered. We will look at the challenges of deploying data science solutions in practice. We categorize them into three groups.</p>"

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Data science is an emerging discipline. That makes it harder to make clean decisions about what any given individual will need to know to become a data scientist. Those of you who are studying now will be those that define the discipline. As we deploy more data driven decision making in the world, the role will be refined. Until we achieve that refinement, your knowledge needs to be broad based.</p>
<p>In this lecture we will first continue our theme of how our limitations as humans mean that our analysis of data can be effected, and I will introduce an analogy that should help you understand <em>how</em> data science differs significantly from traditional software engineering. We’ll then contextualize some of the challenges the domain into three different groups.</p>

<p>As an exercise in understanding complexity, watch the following video. You will see the basketball being bounced around, and the players moving. Your job is to count the passes of those dressed in white and ignore those of the individuals dressed in black.</p>

<p>Figure: Daniel Simon’s famous illusion “monkey business.” Focus on the movement of the ball distracts the viewer from seeing other aspects of the image.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In a classic study <span class="citation" data-cites="Simons-gorillas99">Simons and Chabris (1999)</span> ask subjects to count the number of passes of the basketball between players on the team wearing white shirts. Fifty percent of the time, these subjects don’t notice the gorilla moving across the scene.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of inattentional blindness is well known, e.g in their paper Simons and Charbris quote the Hungarian neurologist, Rezsö Bálint,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a well-known phenomenon that we do not notice anything happening in our surroundings while being absorbed in the inspection of something; focusing our attention on a certain object may happen to such an extent that we cannot perceive other objects placed in the peripheral parts of our visual field, although the light rays they emit arrive completely at the visual sphere of the cerebral cortex.</p>
<p>Rezsö Bálint 1907 (translated in Husain and Stein 1988, page 91)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we combine the complexity of the world with our relatively low bandwidth for information, problems can arise. Our focus on what we perceive to be the most important problem can cause us to miss other (potentially vital) contextual information.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is known as selective attention or ‘inattentional blindness.’</p>

</div>
<p>We are going to see how inattention biases can play out in data analysis by going through a simple example. The analysis involves body mass index and activity information.</p>
<h2 id="bmi-steps-data">BMI Steps Data</h2>
<div style="text-align:right">
<span class="editsection-bracket" style="">[</span><span class="editsection" style=""><a href="https://github.com/lawrennd/talks/edit/gh-pages/_datasets/includes/bmi-steps-data.md" target="_blank" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'Edit Page', 'Edit', 'https://github.com/lawrennd/talks/edit/gh-pages/_datasets/includes/bmi-steps-data.md', 13);">edit</a></span><span class="editsection-bracket" style="">]</span>
</div>
<p>The BMI Steps example is taken from <span class="citation" data-cites="Yanai-hypothesis20">Yanai and Lercher (2020)</span>. We are given a data set of body-mass index measurements against step counts. For convenience we have packaged the data so that it can be easily downloaded.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="im">import</span> pods</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>data <span class="op">=</span> pods.datasets.bmi_steps()</span>

<p>It is good practice to give our variables interpretable names so that the analysis may be clearly understood by others. Here the <code>steps</code> count is the first dimension of the covariate, the <code>bmi</code> is the second dimension and the <code>gender</code> is stored in <code>y</code> with <code>1</code> for female and <code>0</code> for male.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>steps <span class="op">=</span> X[:, <span class="dv">0</span>]</span>

<p>We can check the mean steps and the mean of the BMI.</p>

</div>
<p>We can also separate out the means from the male and female populations. In python this can be done by setting male and female indices as follows.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>male_ind <span class="op">=</span> (gender<span class="op">==</span><span class="dv">0</span>)</span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>female_ind <span class="op">=</span> (gender<span class="op">==</span><span class="dv">1</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And now we can extract the variables for the two populations.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>male_steps <span class="op">=</span> steps[male_ind]</span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>male_bmi <span class="op">=</span> bmi[male_ind]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And as before we compute the mean.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">print</span>(<span class="st">&#39;Male steps mean is </span><span class="sc">{mean}</span><span class="st">.&#39;</span>.<span class="bu">format</span>(mean<span class="op">=</span>male_steps.mean()))</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">print</span>(<span class="st">&#39;Male BMI mean is </span><span class="sc">{mean}</span><span class="st">.&#39;</span>.<span class="bu">format</span>(mean<span class="op">=</span>male_bmi.mean()))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Similarly, we can get the same result for the female portion of the populaton.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>female_steps <span class="op">=</span> steps[female_ind]</span>
<span id="cb10-2"><a href="#cb10-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>female_bmi <span class="op">=</span> bmi[female_ind]</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">print</span>(<span class="st">&#39;Female steps mean is </span><span class="sc">{mean}</span><span class="st">.&#39;</span>.<span class="bu">format</span>(mean<span class="op">=</span>female_steps.mean()))</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb12"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb12-1"><a href="#cb12-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">print</span>(<span class="st">&#39;Female BMI mean is </span><span class="sc">{mean}</span><span class="st">.&#39;</span>.<span class="bu">format</span>(mean<span class="op">=</span>female_bmi.mean()))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Interesting, the female BMI average is slightly higher than the male BMI average. The number of steps in the male group is higher than that in the female group. Perhaps the steps and the BMI are anti-correlated. The more steps, the lower the BMI.</p>
<p>Python provides a statistics package. We’ll import this in <code>python</code> so that we can try and understand the correlation between the <code>steps</code> and the <code>BMI</code>.</p>

<h2 id="a-hypothesis-as-a-liability">A Hypothesis as a Liability</h2>
<p>This analysis is from an article titled “A Hypothesis as a Liability” <span class="citation" data-cites="Yanai-hypothesis20">(Yanai and Lercher, 2020)</span>, they start their article with the following quite from Herman Hesse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“ ‘When someone seeks,’ said Siddhartha, ‘then it easily happens that his eyes see only the thing that he seeks, and he is able to find nothing, to take in nothing. […] Seeking means: having a goal. But finding means: being free, being open, having no goal.’ ”</p>
<p>Hermann Hesse</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their idea is that having a hypothesis can constrain our thinking. However, in answer to their paper <span class="citation" data-cites="Felin-data20">Felin et al. (2021)</span> argue that some form of hypothesis is always necessary, suggesting that a hypothesis <em>can</em> be a liability</p>
<p>My view is captured in the introductory chapter to an edited volume on computational systems biology that I worked on with Mark Girolami, Magnus Rattray and Guido Sanguinetti.</p>

<p>Popper nicely captures the interaction between hypothesis and data by relating it to the chicken and the egg. The important thing is that these two co-evolve.</p>
<h2 id="number-theatre">Number Theatre</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, we don’t always have time to wait for this process to converge to an answer we can all rely on before a decision is required.</p>
<p>Not only can we be misled by data before a decision is made, but sometimes we can be misled by data to justify the making of a decision. David Spiegelhalter refers to the phenomenon of “Number Theatre” in a conversation with Andrew Marr from May 2020 on the presentation of data.</p>

<h2 id="data-theatre">Data Theatre</h2>
<p>Data Theatre exploits data inattention bias to present a particular view on events that may misrepresents through selective presentation. Statisticians are one of the few groups that are trained with a sufficient degree of data skepticism. But it can also be combatted through ensuring there are domain experts present, and that they can speak freely.</p>

<p>One challenge for existing information technology professionals is realizing the extent to which a software ecosystem based on data differs from a classical ecosystem. In particular, by ingesting data we bring unknowns/uncontrollables into our decision-making system. This presents opportunity for adversarial exploitation and unforeseen operation.</p>
<p>blog post on <a href="http://inverseprobability.com/2017/03/14/data-science-as-debugging">Data Science as Debugging</a>.</p>
<p>Starting with the analysis of a data set, the nature of data science is somewhat difference from classical software engineering.</p>
<p>One analogy I find helpful for understanding the depth of change we need is the following. Imagine as a software engineer, you find a USB stick on the ground. And for some reason you <em>know</em> that on that USB stick is a particular API call that will enable you to make a significant positive difference on a business problem. You don’t know which of the many library functions on the USB stick are the ones that will help. And it could be that some of those library functions will hinder, perhaps because they are just inappropriate or perhaps because they have been placed there maliciously. The most secure thing to do would be to <em>not</em> introduce this code into your production system at all. But what if your manager told you to do so, how would you go about incorporating this code base?</p>
<p>The answer is <em>very</em> carefully. You would have to engage in a process more akin to debugging than regular software engineering. As you understood the code base, for your work to be reproducible, you should be documenting it, not just what you discovered, but how you discovered it. In the end, you typically find a single API call that is the one that most benefits your system. But more thought has been placed into this line of code than any line of code you have written before.</p>
<p>An enormous amount of debugging would be required. As the nature of the code base is understood, software tests to verify it also need to be constructed. At the end of all your work, the lines of software you write to actually interact with the software on the USB stick are likely to be minimal. But more thought would be put into those lines than perhaps any other lines of code in the system.</p>
<p>Even then, when your API code is introduced into your production system, it needs to be deployed in an environment that monitors it. We cannot rely on an individual’s decision making to ensure the quality of all our systems. We need to create an environment that includes quality controls, checks and bounds, tests, all designed to ensure that assumptions made about this foreign code base are remaining valid.</p>
<p>This situation is akin to what we are doing when we incorporate data in our production systems. When we are consuming data from others, we cannot assume that it has been produced in alignment with our goals for our own systems. Worst case, it may have been adversarially produced. A further challenge is that data is dynamic. So, in effect, the code on the USB stick is evolving over time.</p>
<p>It might see that this process is easy to formalize now, we simply need to check what the formal software engineering process is for debugging, because that is the current software engineering activity that data science is closest to. But when we look for a formalization of debugging, we find that there is none. Indeed, modern software engineering mainly focusses on ensuring that code is written without bugs in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Anecdotally, resolving a machine learning challenge requires 80% of the resource to be focused on the data and perhaps 20% to be focused on the model. But many companies are too keen to employ machine learning engineers who focus on the models, not the data. We should change our hiring priorities and training. Universities cannot provide the understanding of how to data-wrangle. Companies must fill this gap.</p>

<p>The field of data science is rapidly evolving. Different practitioners from different domains have their own perspectives. In this post we identify three broad challenges that are emerging. Challenges which have not been addressed in the traditional sub-domains of data science. The challenges have social implications but require technological advance for their solutions.</p>
<h2 id="the-big-data-paradox">The Big Data Paradox</h2>
<div style="text-align:right">
<span class="editsection-bracket" style="">[</span><span class="editsection" style=""><a href="https://github.com/lawrennd/talks/edit/gh-pages/_data-science/includes/big-data-paradox.md" target="_blank" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'Edit Page', 'Edit', 'https://github.com/lawrennd/talks/edit/gh-pages/_data-science/includes/big-data-paradox.md', 13);">edit</a></span><span class="editsection-bracket" style="">]</span>
</div>
<p>The big data paradox is the modern phenomenon of “as we collect more data, we understand less.” It is emerging in several domains, political polling, characterization of patients for trials data, monitoring twitter for political sentiment.</p>
<p>I like to think of the phenomenon as relating to the notion of “can’t see the wood for the trees.” Classical statistics, with randomized controlled trials, improved society’s understanding of data. It improved our ability to monitor the forest, to consider population health, voting patterns etc. It is critically dependent on active approaches to data collection that deal with confounders. This data collection can be very expensive.</p>
<p>In business today, it is still the gold standard, A/B tests are used to understand the effect of an intervention on revenue or customer capture or supply chain costs.</p>

<p>The new phenomenon is <em>happenstance data</em>. Data that is not actively collected with a question in mind. As a result, it can mislead us. For example, if we assume the politics of active users of twitter is reflective of the wider population’s politics, then we may be misled.</p>
<p>However, this happenstance data often allows us to characterise a particular individual to a high degree of accuracy. Classical statistics was all about the forest, but big data can often become about the individual tree. As a result we are misled about the situation.</p>
<p>The phenomenon is more dangerous, because our perception is that we are characterizing the wider scenario with ever increasing accuracy. Whereas we are just becoming distracted by detail that may or may not be pertinent to the wider situation.</p>
<p>This is related to our limited bandwidth as humans, and the ease with which we are distracted by detail. The data-inattention-cognitive-bias.</p>
<h2 id="breadth-or-depth-paradox">Breadth or Depth Paradox</h2>
<div style="text-align:right">
<span class="editsection-bracket" style="">[</span><span class="editsection" style=""><a href="https://github.com/lawrennd/talks/edit/gh-pages/_data-science/includes/breadth-or-depth.md" target="_blank" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'Edit Page', 'Edit', 'https://github.com/lawrennd/talks/edit/gh-pages/_data-science/includes/breadth-or-depth.md', 13);">edit</a></span><span class="editsection-bracket" style="">]</span>
</div>
<p>The first challenge we’d like to highlight is the unusual paradoxes of the data society. It is too early to determine whether these paradoxes are fundmental or transient. Evidence for them is still somewhat anecdotal, but they seem worthy of further attention.</p>
<h3 id="the-paradox-of-measurement">The Paradox of Measurement</h3>
<p>We are now able to quantify to a greater and greater degree the actions of individuals in society, and this might lead us to believe that social science, politics, economics are becoming quantifiable. We are able to get a far richer characterization of the world around us. Paradoxically it seems that as we measure more, we understand less.</p>
<p>How could this be possible? It may be that the greater preponderance of data is making society itself more complex. Therefore traditional approaches to measurement (e.g. polling by random sub sampling) are becoming harder, for example due to more complex batch effects, a greater stratification of society where it is more difficult to weigh the various sub-populations correctly.</p>
<p>The end result is that we have a Curate’s egg of a society: it is only ‘measured in parts.’ Whether by examination of social media or through polling we no longer obtain the overall picture that can be necessary to obtain the depth of understanding we require.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/13/new-research-general-election-polls-inaccurate">One example of this phenomenon</a> is the 2015 UK election which polls had as a tie and yet in practice was won by the Conservative party with a seven point advantage. A post-election poll which was truly randomized suggested that this lead was measurable, but pre-election polls are conducted on line and via phone. These approaches can under represent certain sectors. The challenge is that the truly randomized poll is expensive and time consuming. In practice on line and phone polls are usually weighted to reflect the fact that they are not truly randomized, but in a rapidly evolving society the correct weights may move faster than they can be tracked.</p>
<p>Another example is clinical trials. Once again they are the preserve of randomized studies to verify the efficacy of the drug. But now, rather than population becoming more stratified, it is the more personalized nature of the drugs we wish to test. A targeted drug which has efficacy in a sub-population may be harder to test due to difficulty in recruiting the sub-population, the benefit of the drug is also for a smaller sub-group, so expense of drug trials increases.</p>
<p>There are other less clear cut manifestations of this phenomenon. We seem to rely increasingly on social media as a news source, or as a indicator of opinion on a particular subject. But it is beholden to the whims of a vocal minority.</p>
<p>Similar to the way we required more paper when we first developed the computer, the solution is more <em>classical</em> statistics. We need to do more work to verify the tentative conclusions we produce so that we know that our new methodologies are effective.</p>
<p>As we increase the amount of data we acquire, we seem to be able to get better at characterizing the actions of individuals, predicting how they will behave. But we seem, somehow, to be becoming less capable at understanding society. Somehow it seems that as we measure more, we understand less.</p>
<p>That seems counter-intuitive. But perhaps the preponderance of data is making society itself, or the way we measure society, somehow more complex. And in turn, this means that traditional approaches to measurement are failing. So when we realize we are getting better at characterising individuals, perhaps we are only measuring society in parts.</p>
<h2 id="breadth-vs-depth">Breadth vs Depth</h2>
<p>Classical approaches to data analysis made use of many subjects to achieve statistical power. Traditionally, we measure a few things about many people. For example cardiac disease risks can be based on a limited number of factors inmany patients (such as whether the patient smokes, blood pressure, cholesterol levels etc). Because, traditionally, data matrices are stored with individuals in rows and features in columns<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, we refer to this as <em>depth</em> of measurement. In statistics this is sometimes known as the <em>large <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, small <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span></em> domain because traditionally <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is used to denote the number of features we know about an individual and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is used to denote the number of individuals.</p>
<p>The data-revolution is giving us access to far more detail about each individual, this is leading to a <em>breadth</em> of coverage. This characteristic first came to prominence in computational biology and genomics where we became able to record information about mutations and transcription in millions of genes. So <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> became very large, but due to expense of measurement, the number of patients recorded, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, was relatively small. But we now see this increasingly for other domains. With an increasing number of sensors on our wrists or in our mobile phones, we are characterizing indivdiuals in unprecedented detail. This domain can also be effectively dealt with by modifying the models that are used for the data.</p>

<p>So we can know an individual extremely well, or we can know a population well. The saying “Can’t see the wood for the trees,” means we are distracted by the individual trees in a forest, and can’t see the wider context. This seems appropriate for what may be going on here. We are becoming distracted by the information on the individual and we can’t see the wider context of the data.</p>
<p>We know that a rigorous, randomized, study would characterize that forest well, but it seems we are unwilling to invest the money required to do that and the proxies we are using are no longer effective, perhaps because of shifting patterns of behaviour driven by the rapidly evolving digital world.</p>
<p>Further, it’s likely that we are interested in <em>strata</em> within our data set. Equivalent to the structure within the forest: a clearing, a transition between types of tree, a shift in the nature of the undergrowth.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>Examples exhibiting this phenomenon include recent elections, which have proven difficult to predict. Including, the UK 2015 elections, the EU referendum, the US 2016 elections and the UK 2017 elections. In each case individuals may have taken actions on the back of polls that showed one thing or another but turned out to be inaccurate. Indeed, the only accurate pre-election poll for the UK 2017 election, <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/news/2017/05/31/how-yougov-model-2017-general-election-works/">the YouGov poll</a>, was not a traditional poll, it contains a new type of statistical model called <a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2013/10/09/mister-p-whats-its-secret-sauce/">Multilevel Regression and Poststratification (MRP)</a> <span class="citation" data-cites="Gelman:multilevel06">(Gelman and Hill, 2006)</span>.</p>
<p>Another example is stratified medicine. If a therapy is effective only in a sub-type of a disease, then statistical power can be lost across the whole population, particularly when that sub-type is a minority. But characterization of that sub-type is difficult. For example, new cancer immunotherapy treatments can have a dramatic effect, leading to almost total elimination of the cancer in some patients, but characterizing this sub-population is hard. This also makes it hard to develop clinical trials that prove the efficacy of the drugs.</p>
<p>A final example is our measurement of our economy, which increasingly may not capture where value is being generated. This is characterized by the changing nature of work, and the way individuals contribute towards society. For example, the open source community has driven the backbone of the majority of operating system software we use today, as well as cloud compute. But this value is difficult to measure as it was contributed by volunteers, not by a traditional corporate structure. Data itself may be driving this change, because the value of data accumulates in a similar way to the value of capital. The movement of data in the economy, and the value it generates is also hard to measure, and it seems there may be a large class of “have nots,” in terms of those industries whose productivity has suffered relative to the top performers. The so-called productivity gap may not just be due to skills and infrastructure, but also due to data-skills and data-infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id="challenges-1">Challenges</h2>
<p>The nature of the digital society has a closed loop feedback on itself. This is characterized by social media memes, which focus attention on particular issues very quickly. A good example being the photograph of Aylan Kurdi, the young Syrian boy found drowned on a Turkish beach. This photograph had a dramatic effect on attitudes towards immigration, more than the statistics that were showing that thousands were dieing in the Mediterranean each month (see <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hnydewwtido6nhv/VISSOCMEDLAB_AYLAN%20KURDI%20REPORT.pdf?dl=0">this report by the University of Sheffield’s Social Media Lab</a>). Similarly, the changed dynamics of our social circles. Filter bubbles, where our searches and/or newsfeed has been personalized to things that algorithms already know we like. Echo chambers, where we interact mainly with people we agree with and our opinions aren’t challenged. Each of these is changing the dynamic of society, and yet there is a strong temptation to use digital media for surveying information.</p>
<h2 id="solutions">Solutions</h2>
<p>The solutions to these challenges come in three flavours. Firstly, there is a need for more data. In particular data that is actively acquired to cover the gaps in our knowledge. We also need more use of classical statistical techniques, and a wider understanding of what they involve. This situation reminds me somewhat of the idea of the ‘paperless office.’ The innovative research at Xerox PARC that brought us the Graphical User Interface, so prevalent today, was driven by the realization, in the 1970s that eventually offices would stop using paper. Xerox focussed research on what that office would look like as it was a perceived threat to their business. The paperless office may still come, but in practice computers brought about a significant increase in the need for paper due to the additional amounts of information that they caused to be summarized or generated. In a similar way, the world of <em>big data</em> is driving a need for more experimental design and more classical statistics. Any perception of the automated computer algorithm that drives all before it is at least as far away as the paperless office was in the 1970s.</p>
<p>We also need a better social, cognitive and biological understanding of humans and how we and our social structures respond to these interventions. Over time some of the measurables will likely stabilize, but it is not yet clear which ones.</p>

<p>The big data paradox has a sister: the big model paradox. As we build more and more complex models, we start believing that we have a high-fidelity representation of reality. But the complexity of reality is way beyond our feeble imaginings. So we end up with a highly complex model, but one that falls well short in terms of reflecting reality. The complexity of the model means that it moves beyond our understanding.</p>

<p>The situation is reminiscent of a thirsty castaway, set adrift. There is a sea of data, but it is not fit to drink. We need some form of data desalination before it can be consumed. But like real desalination, this is a non trivial process, particularly if we want to achieve it at scale.</p>
<p>There’s a sea of data, but most of it is undrinkable.</p>

<p>We require data-desalination before it can be consumed!</p>
<p>I spoke about the challenges in data science at the NIPS 2016 Workshop on Machine Learning for Health. NIPS mainly focuses on machine learning methodologies, and many of the speakers were doing so. But before my talk, I listened to some of the other speakers talk about the challenges they had with data preparation.</p>
<ul>
<li>90% of our time is spent on validation and integration (Leo Anthony Celi)</li>
<li>“The Dirty Work We Don’t Want to Think About” (Eric Xing)</li>
<li>“Voodoo to get it decompressed” (Francisco Giminez)</li>
</ul>
<p>A further challenge in healthcare is that the data is collected by clinicians, often at great inconvenience to both themselves and the patient, but the control of the data is sometimes used to steer the direction of research.</p>
<p>The fact that we put so much effort into processing the data, but so little into allocating credit for this work is a major challenge for realizing the benefit in the data we have.</p>
<p>This type of work is somewhat thankless, with the exception of the clinicians’ control of the data, which probably takes things too far, those that collate and correct data sets gain little credit. In the domain of <em>reinforcement learning</em> the aim is to take a series of actions to achieve a stated goal and gain a reward. The <em>credit assignment problem</em> is the challenge in the learning algorithm of distributing credit to each of the actions which brought about the reward. We also experience this problem in society, we use proxies such as monetary reward to incentivise intermediate steps in our economy. Modern society functions because we agree to make basic expenditure on infrastructure, such as roads, which we all make use of. Our data-society is not sufficiently mature to be correctly crediting and rewarding those that undertake this work.</p>
<p>This situation is no better in industry than in academia. Many companies have been persuaded to accumulate all their data centrally in a so-called “data lake.” This attractive idea is problematic, because data is added to the “lake” without thought to its quality. As a result, a better name for these resources would be data swamps. Because the quality of data in them is often dubious. Data scientists when working with these sources often need to develop their own processes for checking the quality of the data before it is used. Unfortunately, the quality improvements they make are rarely fed back into the ecosystem, meaning the same purification work needs to be done repeatedly.</p>
<p>We need to properly incetivize the sharing and production of clean data sets, we need to correctly quantify the value in the contribution of each actor, otherwise there won’t be enough clean data to satiate the thirst of our decision making processes.</p>

<p>The value of shared data infrastructures in computational biology was recognized by the 2010 joint statement from the Wellcome Trust and other funders of research at the “Foggy Bottom” meeting. They recognised three key benefits to sharing of health data:</p>
<ul>
<li>faster progress in improving health</li>
<li>better value for money</li>
<li>higher quality science</li>
</ul>
<p>But incentivising sharing requires incentivising collection and collation of data, and the associated credit allocation models.</p>

<p>Data-readiness describes, at its coarsest level, three separate stages of data graduation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grade C - accessibility
<ul>
<li>Transition: data becomes electronically available</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Grade B - validity
<ul>
<li>Transition: pose a question to the data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Grade A - usability</li>
</ul>
<p>The important definitions are at the transition. The move from Grade C data to Grade B data is delimited by the <em>electronic availability</em> of the data. The move from Grade B to Grade A data is delimited by posing a question or task to the data <span class="citation" data-cites="Lawrence:drl17">(<strong>Lawrence:drl17?</strong>)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="accessibility-grade-c">Accessibility: Grade C</h2>
<p>The first grade refers to the accessibility of data. Most data science practitioners will be used to working with data-providers who, perhaps having had little experience of data-science before, state that they “have the data.” More often than not, they have not verified this. A convenient term for this is “Hearsay Data,” someone has <em>heard</em> that they have the data so they <em>say</em> they have it. This is the lowest grade of data readiness.</p>
<p>Progressing through Grade C involves ensuring that this data is accessible. Not just in terms of digital accessiblity, but also for regulatory, ethical and intellectual property reasons.</p>
<h2 id="validity-grade-b">Validity: Grade B</h2>
<p>Data transits from Grade C to Grade B once we can begin digital analysis on the computer. Once the challenges of access to the data have been resolved, we can make the data available either via API, or for direct loading into analysis software (such as Python, R, Matlab, Mathematica or SPSS). Once this has occured the data is at B4 level. Grade B involves the <em>validity</em> of the data. Does the data really represent what it purports to? There are challenges such as missing values, outliers, record duplication. Each of these needs to be investigated.</p>
<p>Grade B and C are important as if the work done in these grades is documented well, it can be reused in other projects. Reuse of this labour is key to reducing the costs of data-driven automated decision making. There is a strong overlap between the work required in this grade and the statistical field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis"><em>exploratory data analysis</em></a> <span class="citation" data-cites="Tukey:exploratory77">(Tukey, 1977)</span>.</p>
<p>The need for Grade B emerges due to the fundamental change in the availability of data. Classically, the scientific question came first, and the data came later. This is still the approach in a randomized control trial, e.g. in A/B testing or clinical trials for drugs. Today data is being laid down by happenstance, and the question we wish to ask about the data often comes after the data has been created. The Grade B of data readiness ensures thought can be put into data quality <em>before</em> the question is defined. It is this work that is reusable across multiple teams. It is these processes that the team which is <em>standing up</em> the data must deliver.</p>
<h2 id="usability-grade-a">Usability: Grade A</h2>
<p>Once the validity of the data is determined, the data set can be considered for use in a particular task. This stage of data readiness is more akin to what machine learning scientists are used to doing in Universities. Bringing an algorithm to bear on a well understood data set.</p>
<p>In Grade A we are concerned about the utility of the data given a particular task. Grade A may involve additional data collection (experimental design in statistics) to ensure that the task is fulfilled.</p>
<p>This is the stage where the data and the model are brought together, so expertise in learning algorithms and their application is key. Further ethical considerations, such as the fairness of the resulting predictions are required at this stage. At the end of this stage a prototype model is ready for deployment.</p>
<p>Deployment and maintenance of machine learning models in production is another important issue which Data Readiness Levels are only a part of the solution for.</p>

<p>Throughout the data preparation pipeline, it is important to have close interaction between data scientists and application domain experts. Decisions on data preparation taken outside the context of application have dangerous downstream consequences. This provides an additional burden on the data scientist as they are required for each project, but it should also be seen as a learning and familiarization exercise for the domain expert. Long term, just as biologists have found it necessary to assimilate the skills of the bioinformatician to be effective in their science, most domains will also require a familiarity with the nature of data driven decision making and its application. Working closely with data-scientists on data preparation is one way to begin this sharing of best practice.</p>
<p>The processes involved in Grade C and B are often badly taught in courses on data science. Perhaps not due to a lack of interest in the areas, but maybe more due to a lack of access to real world examples where data quality is poor.</p>
<p>These stages of data science are also ridden with ambiguity. In the long term they could do with more formalization, and automation, but best practice needs to be understood by a wider community before that can happen.</p>

<p>Assessing the readiness of data for analysis is one action that can be taken, but assessing teams that need to assimilate the information in the data is the other side of the coin. With this in mind both <a href="https://medium.com/@damoncivin/the-joel-test-for-data-readiness-4882aae64753">Damon Civin</a> and <a href="https://blog.dominodatalab.com/joel-test-data-science/">Nick Elprin</a> have independently proposed the idea of a “Data Joel Test.” A “<a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/">Joel Test</a>” is a short questionaire to establish the ability of a team to handle software engineering tasks. It is designed as a rough and ready capability assessment. A “Data Joel Test” is similar, but for assessing the capability of a team in performing data science.</p>

<p>Embodiment factors imply that, in our communication between humans, what is <em>not</em> said is, perhaps, more important than what is said. To communicate with each other we need to have a model of who each of us are.</p>
<p>To aid this, in society, we are required to perform roles. Whether as a parent, a teacher, an employee or a boss. Each of these roles requires that we conform to certain standards of behaviour to facilitate communication between ourselves.</p>
<p>Control of self is vitally important to these communications.</p>
<p>The high availability of data available to humans undermines human-to-human communication channels by providing new routes to undermining our control of self.</p>
<p>The consequences between this mismatch of power and delivery are to be seen all around us. Because, just as driving an F1 car with bicycle wheels would be a fine art, so is the process of communication between humans.</p>
<p>If I have a thought and I wish to communicate it, I first of all need to have a model of what you think. I should think before I speak. When I speak, you may react. You have a model of who I am and what I was trying to say, and why I chose to say what I said. Now we begin this dance, where we are each trying to better understand each other and what we are saying. When it works, it is beautiful, but when misdeployed, just like a badly driven F1 car, there is a horrible crash, an argument.</p>

<p>What does it mean for our free will if a computer can predict our individual behavior better than we ourselves can?</p>
<p>There is potential for both explicit and implicit discrimination on the basis of race, religion, sexuality or health status. All of these are prohibited under European law, but can pass unawares or be implicit.</p>
<p>The GDPR is the General Data Protection Regulation, but a better name for it would simpl by Good Data Practice Rules. It covers how to deal with discrimination which has a consequential effect on the individual. For example, entrance to University, access to loans or insurance. But the new phenomenon is dealing with a series of inconsequential decisions that taken together have a consequential effect.</p>

<p>Statistics as a community is also focussed on the single consequential effect of an analysis (efficacy of drugs, or distribution of Mosquito nets). Associated with happenstance data is <em>happenstance decision making</em>.</p>
<p>These algorithms behind these decisions are developed in a particular context. The so-called Silicon Valley bubble. But they are deployed across the world. To address this, a key challenge is capacity building in contexts which are remote from the Western norm.</p>

<p>Data Science Africa is a bottom up initiative for capacity building in data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence on the African continent.</p>
<p>As of October 2021 there have been five workshops and five schools, located in Nyeri, Kenya (twice); Kampala, Uganda; Arusha, Tanzania; Abuja, Nigeria; Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Accra, Ghana; Kampala, Uganda and Kimberley, South Africa.</p>
<p>The main notion is <em>end-to-end</em> data science. For example, going from data collection in the farmer’s field to decision making in the Ministry of Agriculture. Or going from malaria disease counts in health centers to medicine distribution.</p>
<p>The philosophy is laid out in <span class="citation" data-cites="Lawrence:dsa15">(Lawrence, 2015)</span>. The key idea is that the modern <em>information infrastructure</em> presents new solutions to old problems. Modes of development change because less capital investment is required to take advantage of this infrastructure. The philosophy is that local capacity building is the right way to leverage these challenges in addressing data science problems in the African context.</p>
<p>Data Science Africa is now a non-govermental organization registered in Kenya. The organising board of the meeting is entirely made up of scientists and academics based on the African continent.</p>

<p>As an example of using Gaussian process models within the full pipeline from data to decsion, we’ll consider the prediction of Malaria incidence in Uganda. For the purposes of this study malaria reports come in two forms, HMIS reports from health centres and Sentinel data, which is curated by the WHO. There are limited sentinel sites and many HMIS sites.</p>
<p>The work is from Ricardo Andrade Pacheco’s PhD thesis, completed in collaboration with John Quinn and Martin Mubangizi <span class="citation" data-cites="Andrade:consistent14 Mubangizi:malaria14">(Andrade-Pacheco et al., 2014; Mubangizi et al., 2014)</span>. John and Martin were initally from the AI-DEV group from the University of Makerere in Kampala and more latterly they were based at UN Global Pulse in Kampala. You can see the work summarized on the UN Global Pulse <a href="https://diseaseoutbreaks.unglobalpulse.net/uganda/">disease outbreaks project site here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>See <a href="https://diseaseoutbreaks.unglobalpulse.net/uganda/">UN Global Pulse Disease Outbreaks Site</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Malaria data is spatial data. Uganda is split into districts, and health reports can be found for each district. This suggests that models such as conditional random fields could be used for spatial modelling, but there are two complexities with this. First of all, occasionally districts split into two. Secondly, sentinel sites are a specific location within a district, such as Nagongera which is a sentinel site based in the Tororo district.</p>

<p>Health monitoring system for the Kabarole district. Here we have fitted the reports with a Gaussian process with an additive covariance function. It has two components, one is a long time scale component (in red above) the other is a short time scale component (in blue).</p>
<p>Monitoring proceeds by considering two aspects of the curve. Is the blue line (the short term report signal) above the red (which represents the long term trend? If so we have higher than expected reports. If this is the case <em>and</em> the gradient is still positive (i.e. reports are going up) we encode this with a <em>red</em> color. If it is the case and the gradient of the blue line is negative (i.e. reports are going down) we encode this with an <em>amber</em> color. Conversely, if the blue line is below the red <em>and</em> decreasing, we color <em>green</em>. On the other hand if it is below red but increasing, we color <em>yellow</em>.</p>
<p>This gives us an early warning system for disease. Red is a bad situation getting worse, amber is bad, but improving. Green is good and getting better and yellow good but degrading.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a gray region which represents when the scale of the effect is small.</p>

<p>The machine learning solutions we are dependent on to drive automated decision making are dependent on data. But with regard to personal data there are important issues of privacy. Data sharing brings benefits, but also exposes our digital selves. From the use of social media data for targeted advertising to influence us, to the use of genetic data to identify criminals, or natural family members. Control of our virtual selves maps on to control of our actual selves.</p>
<p>The fuedal system that is implied by current data protection legislation has signficant power asymmetries at its heart, in that the data controller has a duty of care over the data subject, but the data subject may only discover failings in that duty of care when it’s too late. Data controllers also may have conflicting motivations, and often their primary motivation is <em>not</em> towards the data-subject, but that is a consideration in their wider agenda.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/jun/03/data-trusts-privacy-fears-feudalism-democracy">Personal Data Trusts</a> <span class="citation" data-cites="Edwards:privacy04 Lawrence:trusts16 Delacroix:trusts18">(Delacroix and Lawrence, 2018; Edwards, 2004; Lawrence, 2016)</span> are a potential solution to this problem. Inspired by <em>land societies</em> that formed in the 19th century to bring democratic representation to the growing middle classes. A land society was a mutual organisation where resources were pooled for the common good.</p>
<p>A Personal Data Trust would be a legal entity where the trustees responsibility was entirely to the members of the trust. So the motivation of the data-controllers is aligned only with the data-subjects. How data is handled would be subject to the terms under which the trust was convened. The success of an individual trust would be contingent on it satisfying its members with appropriate balancing of individual privacy with the benefits of data sharing.</p>
<p>Formation of Data Trusts became the number one recommendation of the Hall-Presenti report on AI, but unfortunately, the term was confounded with more general approaches to data sharing that don’t necessarily involve fiduciary responsibilities or personal data rights. It seems clear that we need to better characterise the data sharing landscape as well as propose mechanisms for tackling specific issues in data sharing.</p>
<p>It feels important to have a diversity of approaches, and yet it feels important that any individual trust would be large enough to be taken seriously in representing the views of its members in wider negotiations.</p>

<p>Addressing challenges in privacy, loss of control and marginalization includes ensuring that the individual retains control of their own data. We accept privacy in our real loves, we need to accept it in our digital persona. This is vital for our control of persona and our ability to project ourselves.</p>
<p>Fairness goes hand in hand with privacy to protect the individual. Regulations like the GDPR date from a time where the main worry was <em>consequential</em> decision making but today we also face problems from accumulation of inconsequential decisions leading to a resulting consequential effect.</p>
<p>Capacity building in different contexts, empowering domain experts to solve their own problems, is one aspect to the solution. A further proposal is the use of data trusts to reintroduce control of personal data for the individual.</p>
