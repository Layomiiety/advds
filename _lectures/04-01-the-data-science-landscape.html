title: "The Data Science Landscape"
venue: "LT2, William Gates Building"
abstract: "<p>This lecture will introduce us to the context of why we
are doing data science. What is data science and how does it differ from
classical statistics, machine learning and artificial intelligence. We
will set the context by introducing the notion of <em>embodiment
factors</em>. These factors allow us to characterize human and machine
intelligence and highlight that in the modern data driven world a
symbiotic relationship with the machine is emerging. Unfortunately, the
high bandwidth capability of the machine means that it has at a
disadvantage. Just as the field of mathematical statistics developed to
mediate the relationship between humans and data, the field of data
science is emerging to mediate the relationship between human machine
and data. This background will give the context to what will follow in
the rest of the course where you will gain practical skills and
experience of developing the full data science pipeline.</p>"

<p>The course is lectured by Carl Henrik Ek and Neil D. Lawrence</p>
<h2 id="an-emerging-field">An Emerging Field</h2>
<p>Data science is an emerging field, in this unit we’ll introduce you
to the phenomena that are triggering it, and the challenges we face. It
is not an activity that is currently done <em>well</em>. In some places
it is done better than others, but there’s a particular onus on us as
educators, and you as students, to realize that our understanding of the
challenge is evolving. That evolving understanding requires us to adapt
to the problems as they develop and maintain a wider contextual
understanding of the effects we are having on society.</p>
<p>For that reason, the unit is not purely technical, it is at times
philosophical and ethical. That is not to say we have a unique access to
the philosophies and ethics that are required to undertake the
challenges of data science, but to trigger your thinking because you are
in the generation of computer scientists on whom the burden of
responsibility is falling to address these challenges.</p>
<p>Your assessments are designed to develop these skills alongside your
technical understanding. They are ambitious in their scope, but unless
you see the entire data science pipeline you won’t be prepared to
assimilate the challenges we’re facing. Our aim is to guide you through
the challenges of the assessment through the lab sessions and practicals
and to ensure that you develop your understanding of these challenges
with our help.</p>
<p>The teaching is based not only on technical experience of the machine
learning community, but real-world experience of deploying and/or
assisting with deployments of data science solutions at Amazon, for
pandemic policy advice and in the African context (particularly Uganda
and Kenya).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are three types of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics</p>
<p>Arthur Balfour 1848-1930</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arthur Balfour was quoting the lawyer James Munro<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
when he said that there three types of lies: lies, damned lies and
statistics in 1892. This is 20 years before the first academic
department of applied statistics was founded at UCL. If Balfour were
alive today, it is likely that he’d rephrase his quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are three types of lies, lies damned lies and <em>big
data</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why? Because the challenges of understanding and interpreting big
data today are similar to those that Balfour (who was a Conservative
politician and statesman and would later become Prime Minister) faced in
governing an empire through statistics in the latter part of the 19th
century.</p>
<p>The quote lies, damned lies and statistics was also credited to
Benjamin Disraeli by Mark Twain in Twain’s autobiography.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> It
characterizes the idea that statistic can be made to prove anything. But
Disraeli died in 1881 and Mark Twain died in 1910. The important
breakthrough in overcoming our tendency to over-interpet data came with
the formalization of the field through the development of
<em>mathematical statistics</em>.</p>
<p>Data has an elusive quality, it promises so much but can deliver
little, it can mislead and misrepresent. To harness it, it must be
tamed. In Balfour and Disraeli’s time during the second half of the 19th
century, numbers and data were being accumulated, the social sciences
were being developed. There was a large-scale collection of data for the
purposes of government.</p>
<p>The modern ‘big data era’ is on the verge of delivering the same
sense of frustration that Balfour experienced, the early promise of big
data as a panacea is evolving to demands for delivery. For me,
personally, peak-hype coincided with an email I received inviting
collaboration on a project to deploy “<em>Big Data</em> and <em>Internet
of Things</em> in an <em>Industry 4.0</em> environment”. Further
questioning revealed that the actual project was optimization of the
efficiency of a manufacturing production line, a far more tangible and
<em>realizable</em> goal.</p>
<p>The antidote to this verbiage is found in increasing awareness. When
dealing with data the first trap to avoid is the games of buzzword bingo
that we are wont to play. The first goal is to quantify what challenges
can be addressed and what techniques are required. Behind the hype
fundamentals are changing. The phenomenon is about the increasing access
we have to data. The way customers’ information is recorded and
processes are codified and digitized with little overhead. Internet of
things is about the increasing number of cheap sensors that can be
easily interconnected through our modern network structures. But
businesses are about making money, and these phenomena need to be recast
in those terms before their value can be realized.</p>
<p>For more thoughts on the challenges that statistics brings see

<h2 id="mathematical-statistics"><em>Mathematical</em> Statistics</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Pearson">Karl Pearson</a>
(1857-1936), <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher">Ronald Fisher</a>
(1890-1962) and others considered the question of what conclusions can
truly be drawn from data. Their mathematical studies act as a restraint
on our tendency to over-interpret and see patterns where there are none.
They introduced concepts such as randomized control trials that form a
mainstay of our decision making today, from government, to clinicians to
large scale A/B testing that determines the nature of the web interfaces
we interact with on social media and shopping.</p>

<p>Their movement did the most to put statistics to rights, to eradicate
the ‘damned lies’. It was known as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_statistics">‘mathematical
statistics’</a>. Today I believe we should look to the emerging field of
<em>data science</em> to provide the same role. Data science is an
amalgam of statistics, data mining, computer systems, databases,
computation, machine learning and artificial intelligence. Spread across
these fields are the tools we need to realize data’s potential. For many
businesses this might be thought of as the challenge of ‘converting bits
into atoms’. Bits: the data stored on computer, atoms: the physical
manifestation of what we do; the transfer of goods, the delivery of
service. From fungible to tangible. When solving a challenge through
data there are a series of obstacles that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>Firstly, data awareness: what data you have and where its stored.
Sometimes this includes changing your conception of what data is and how
it can be obtained. From automated production lines to apps on employee
smart phones. Often data is locked away: manual logbooks, confidential
data, personal data. For increasing awareness an internal audit can
help. The website <a href="https://data.gov.uk/">data.gov.uk</a> hosts
data made available by the UK government. To create this website the
government’s departments went through an audit of what data they each
hold and what data they could make available. Similarly, within private
businesses this type of audit could be useful for understanding their
internal digital landscape: after all the key to any successful campaign
is a good map.</p>
<p>Secondly, availability. How well are the data sources interconnected?
How well curated are they? The curse of Disraeli was associated with
unreliable data and <em>unreliable statistics</em>. The
misrepresentations this leads to are worse than the absence of data as
they give a false sense of confidence to decision making. Understanding
how to avoid these pitfalls involves an improved sense of data and its
value, one that needs to permeate the organization.</p>
<p>The final challenge is analysis, the accumulation of the necessary
expertise to digest what the data tells us. Data requires
interpretation, and interpretation requires experience. Analysis is
providing a bottleneck due to a skill shortage, a skill shortage made
more acute by the fact that, ideally, analysis should be carried out by
individuals not only skilled in data science but also equipped with the
domain knowledge to understand the implications in a given application,
and to see opportunities for improvements in efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="mathematical-data-science">‘Mathematical Data Science’</h2>
<p>As a term ‘big data’ promises much and delivers little, to get true
value from data, it needs to be curated and evaluated. The three stages
of awareness, availability and analysis provide a broad framework
through which organizations should be assessing the potential in the
data they hold. Hand waving about big data solutions will not do, it
will only lead to self-deception. The castles we build on our data
landscapes must be based on firm foundations, process and scientific
analysis. If we do things right, those are the foundations that will be
provided by the new field of data science.</p>
<p>Today the statement “There are three types of lies: lies, damned lies
and ‘big data’” may be more apt. We are revisiting many of the mistakes
made in interpreting data from the 19th century. Big data is laid down
by happenstance, rather than actively collected with a particular
question in mind. That means it needs to be treated with care when
conclusions are being drawn. For data science to succeed it needs the
same form of rigor that Pearson and Fisher brought to statistics, a
“mathematical data science” is needed.</p>

<p>Figure: Embodiment factors are the ratio between our ability to

also locked in. In the table we represent embodiment as the length of
time it would take to communicate one second’s worth of computation. For
computers it is a matter of minutes, but for a human, it is a matter of
thousands of millions of years. See also “Living Together: Mind and

<p>There is a fundamental limit placed on our intelligence based on our
ability to communicate. Claude Shannon founded the field of information
theory. The clever part of this theory is it allows us to separate our
measurement of information from what the information pertains to.<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Shannon measured information in bits. One bit of information is the
amount of information I pass to you when I give you the result of a coin
toss. Shannon was also interested in the amount of information in the
English language. He estimated that on average a word in the English
language contains 12 bits of information.</p>
<p>Given typical speaking rates, that gives us an estimate of our
ability to communicate of around 100 bits per second <span
class="citation" data-cites="Reed-information98">(Reed and Durlach,
1998)</span>. Computers on the other hand can communicate much more
rapidly. Current wired network speeds are around a billion bits per
second, ten million times faster.</p>
<p>When it comes to compute though, our best estimates indicate our
computers are slower. A typical modern computer can process make around
100 billion floating-point operations per second, each floating-point
operation involves a 64 bit number. So the computer is processing around
6,400 billion bits per second.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to get similar estimates for humans, but by some
estimates the amount of compute we would require to <em>simulate</em> a
human brain is equivalent to that in the UK’s fastest computer <span
class="citation" data-cites="Ananthanarayanan-cat09">(Ananthanarayanan
et al., 2009)</span>, the MET office machine in Exeter, which in 2018
ranked as the 11th fastest computer in the world. That machine simulates
the world’s weather each morning, and then simulates the world’s climate
in the afternoon. It is a 16-petaflop machine, processing around 1,000
<em>trillion</em> bits per second.</p>

<p>So, when it comes to our ability to compute we are extraordinary, not
compute in our conscious mind, but the underlying neuron firings that
underpin both our consciousness, our subconsciousness as well as our
motor control etc.</p>
<p>If we think of ourselves as vehicles, then we are massively
overpowered. Our ability to generate derived information from raw fuel
is extraordinary. Intellectually we have formula one engines.</p>
<p>But in terms of our ability to deploy that computation in actual use,
to share the results of what we have inferred, we are very limited. So,
when you imagine the F1 car that represents a psyche, think of an F1 car
with bicycle wheels.</p>

<p>Just think of the control a driver would have to have to deploy such
power through such a narrow channel of traction. That is the beauty and

with well-matched tires. They can communicate far more fluidly. They are
more efficient, but somehow less extraordinary, less beautiful.</p>

<p>For humans, that means much of our computation should be dedicated to
considering <em>what</em> we should compute. To do that efficiently we
need to model the world around us. The most complex thing in the world
around us is other humans. So, it is no surprise that we model them. We
second guess what their intentions are, and our communication is only
necessary when they are departing from how we model them. Naturally, for
this to work well, we need to understand those we work closely with. It
is no surprise that social communication, social bonding, forms so much
of a part of our use of our limited bandwidth.</p>
<p>There is a second effect here, our need to anthropomorphize objects
around us. Our tendency to model our fellow humans extends to when we
interact with other entities in our environment. To our pets as well as
inanimate objects around us, such as computers or even our cars. This
tendency to over interpret could be a consequence of our limited ability
to communicate.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"

<p>Embodiment factors imply that, in our communication between humans,
what is <em>not</em> said is, perhaps, more important than what is said.
To communicate with each other we need to have a model of who each of us
are.</p>
<p>To aid this, in society, we are required to perform roles. Whether as
a parent, a teacher, an employee or a boss. Each of these roles requires
that we conform to certain standards of behaviour to facilitate
communication between ourselves.</p>
<p>Control of self is vitally important to these communications.</p>
<p>The high availability of data available to humans undermines
human-to-human communication channels by providing new routes to
undermining our control of self.</p>
<p>The consequences between this mismatch of power and delivery are to
be seen all around us. Because, just as driving an F1 car with bicycle
wheels would be a fine art, so is the process of communication between
humans.</p>
<p>If I have a thought and I wish to communicate it, I first need to
have a model of what you think. I should think before I speak. When I
speak, you may react. You have a model of who I am and what I was trying
to say, and why I chose to say what I said. Now we begin this dance,
where we are each trying to better understand each other and what we are
saying. When it works, it is beautiful, but when mis-deployed, just like
a badly driven F1 car, there is a horrible crash, an argument.</p>

these are crudely drawn objects, but in another way, the animator has

<p>Figure: Consider the six-word novel, apocryphally credited to Ernest
Hemingway, “For sale: baby shoes, never worn”. To understand what that
means to a human, you need a great deal of additional context. Context
that is not directly accessible to a machine that has not got both the
evolved and contextual understanding of our own condition to realize
both the implication of the advert and what that implication means
emotionally to the previous owner.</p>

<p>But this is a very different kind of intelligence than ours. A

<p>Similarly, we find it difficult to comprehend how computers are
making decisions. Because they do so with more data than we can possibly
imagine.</p>
<p>In many respects, this is not a problem, it’s a good thing. Computers
and us are good at different things. But when we interact with a
computer, when it acts in a different way to us, we need to remember
why.</p>
<p>Just as the first step to getting along with other humans is
understanding other humans, so it needs to be with getting along with
our computers.</p>
<p>Embodiment factors explain why, at the same time, computers are so
impressive in simulating our weather, but so poor at predicting our
moods. Our complexity is greater than that of our weather, and each of
us is tuned to read and respond to one another.</p>
<p>Their intelligence is different. It is based on very large quantities
of data that we cannot absorb. Our computers don’t have a complex
internal model of who we are. They don’t understand the human condition.
They are not tuned to respond to us as we are to each other.</p>
<p>Embodiment factors encapsulate a profound thing about the nature of
humans. Our locked in intelligence means that we are striving to
communicate, so we put a lot of thought into what we’re communicating
with. And if we’re communicating with something complex, we naturally
anthropomorphize them.</p>
<p>We give our dogs, our cats, and our cars human motivations. We do the
same with our computers. We anthropomorphize them. We assume that they
have the same objectives as us and the same constraints. They don’t.</p>
<p>This means, that when we worry about artificial intelligence, we
worry about the wrong things. We fear computers that behave like more
powerful versions of ourselves that will struggle to outcompete us.</p>
<p>In reality, the challenge is that our computers cannot be human
enough. They cannot understand us with the depth we understand one
another. They drop below our cognitive radar and operate outside our
mental models.</p>
<p>The real danger is that computers don’t anthropomorphize. They’ll
make decisions in isolation from us without our supervision because they
can’t communicate truly and deeply with us.</p>

<p>The high bandwidth of computers has resulted in a close relationship
between the computer and data. Large amounts of information can flow
between the two. The degree to which the computer is mediating our
relationship with data means that we should consider it an
intermediary.</p>
<p>Originally our low bandwidth relationship with data was affected by
two characteristics. Firstly, our tendency to over-interpret driven by
our need to extract as much knowledge from our low bandwidth information
channel as possible. Secondly, by our improved understanding of the
domain of <em>mathematical</em> statistics and how our cognitive biases
can mislead us.</p>
<p>With this new set up there is a potential for assimilating far more
information via the computer, but the computer can present this to us in
various ways. If its motives are not aligned with ours then it can
misrepresent the information. This needn’t be nefarious it can be simply
because of the computer pursuing a different objective from us. For
example, if the computer is aiming to maximize our interaction time that
may be a different objective from ours which may be to summarize
information in a representative manner in the <em>shortest</em> possible
length of time.</p>
<p>For example, for me, it was a common experience to pick up my
telephone with the intention of checking when my next appointment was,
but to soon find myself distracted by another application on the phone
and end up reading something on the internet. By the time I’d finished
reading, I would often have forgotten the reason I picked up my phone in
the first place.</p>
<p>There are great benefits to be had from the huge amount of
information we can unlock from this evolved relationship between us and
data. In biology, large scale data sharing has been driven by a
revolution in genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic measurement. The
improved inferences that can be drawn through summarizing data by
computer have fundamentally changed the nature of biological science,
now this phenomenon is also influencing us in our daily lives as data
measured by <em>happenstance</em> is increasingly used to characterize
us.</p>
<p>Better mediation of this flow requires a better understanding of
human-computer interaction. This in turn involves understanding our own
intelligence better, what its cognitive biases are and how these might
mislead us.</p>

<p>Classically the field of statistics focused on mediating the
relationship between the machine and the human. Our limited bandwidth of
communication means we tend to over-interpret the limited information
that we are given, in the extreme we assign motives and desires to
inanimate objects (a process known as anthropomorphizing). Much of
mathematical statistics was developed to help temper this tendency and
understand when we are valid in drawing conclusions from data.</p>

<p>Figure: The trinity of human, data, and computer, and highlights the
modern phenomenon. The communication channel between computer and data
now has an extremely high bandwidth. The channel between human and
computer and the channel between data and human is narrow. New direction
of information flow, information is reaching us mediated by the
computer. The focus on classical statistics reflected the importance of
the direct communication between human and data. The modern challenges
of data science emerge when that relationship is being mediated by the
machine.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Data science brings new challenges. In particular, there is a very
large bandwidth connection between the machine and data. This means that
our relationship with data is now commonly being mediated by the
machine. Whether this is in the acquisition of new data, which now
happens by happenstance rather than with purpose, or the interpretation
of that data where we are increasingly relying on machines to summarize
what the data contains. This is leading to the emerging field of data
science, which must not only deal with the same challenges that
mathematical statistics faced in tempering our tendency to over
interpret data but must also deal with the possibility that the machine
has either inadvertently or maliciously misrepresented the underlying
data.</p>
