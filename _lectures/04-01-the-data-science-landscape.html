title: "The Data Science Landscape"
venue: "LT2, William Gates Building"
abstract: "<p>This lecture will introduce us to the context of why we
are doing data science. What is data science and how does it differ from
classical statistics, machine learning and artificial intelligence. We
will set the context by introducing the notion of <em>embodiment
factors</em>. These factors allow us to characterize human and machine
intelligence and highlight that in the modern data driven world a
symbiotic relationship with the machine is emerging. Unfortunately, the
high bandwidth capability of the machine means that it has at a
disadvantage. Just as the field of mathematical statistics developed to
mediate the relationship between humans and data, the field of data
science is emerging to mediate the relationship between human machine
and data. This background will give the context to what will follow in
the rest of the course where you will gain practical skills and
experience of developing the full data science pipeline.</p>"

<p>The course is lectured by Carl Henrik Ek and Christian Cabrera and
Neil D. Lawrence</p>
<h2 id="an-emerging-field">An Emerging Field</h2>
<p>Data science is an emerging field, in this unit we’ll introduce you
to the phenomena that are triggering it, and the challenges we face. It
is not an activity that is currently done <em>well</em>. In some places
it is done better than others, but there’s a particular onus on us as
educators, and you as students, to realize that our understanding of the
challenge is evolving. That evolving understanding requires us to adapt
to the problems as they develop and maintain a wider contextual
understanding of the effects we are having on society.</p>
<p>For that reason, the unit is not purely technical, it is at times
philosophical and ethical. That is not to say we have a unique access to
the philosophies and ethics that are required to undertake the
challenges of data science, but to trigger your thinking because you are
in the generation of computer scientists on whom the burden of
responsibility is falling to address these challenges.</p>
<p>Your assessments are designed to develop these skills alongside your
technical understanding. They are ambitious in their scope, but unless
you see the entire data science pipeline you won’t be prepared to
assimilate the challenges we’re facing. Our aim is to guide you through
the challenges of the assessment through the lab sessions and practicals
and to ensure that you develop your understanding of these challenges
with our help.</p>
<p>The teaching is based not only on technical experience of the machine
learning community, but real-world experience of deploying and/or
assisting with deployments of data science solutions at Amazon, for
pandemic policy advice and in the African context (particularly Uganda
and Kenya).</p>

<p>It’s said that Henry Ford’s customers wanted a “a faster horse”. If
Henry Ford was selling us artificial intelligence today, what would the
customer call for, “a smarter human”? That’s certainly the picture of
machine intelligence we find in science fiction narratives, but the
reality of what we’ve developed is much more mundane.</p>
<p>Car engines produce prodigious power from petrol. Machine
intelligences deliver decisions derived from data. In both cases the
scale of consumption enables a speed of operation that is far beyond the
capabilities of their natural counterparts. Unfettered energy
consumption has consequences in the form of climate change. Does
unbridled data consumption also have consequences for us?</p>
<p>If we devolve decision making to machines, we depend on those
machines to accommodate our needs. If we don’t understand how those
machines operate, we lose control over our destiny. Our mistake has been
to see machine intelligence as a reflection of our intelligence. We
cannot understand the smarter human without understanding the human. To
understand the machine, we need to better understand ourselves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are three types of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics</p>
<p>Arthur Balfour 1848-1930</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arthur Balfour was quoting the lawyer James Munro<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
when he said that there three types of lies: lies, damned lies and
statistics in 1892. This is 20 years before the first academic
department of applied statistics was founded at UCL.</p>
<p>If Balfour were alive today, it is likely that he’d rephrase his
quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are three types of lies, lies damned lies and <em>big
data</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why? Because the challenges of understanding and interpreting big
data today are similar to those that Balfour (who was a Conservative
politician and statesman and would later become Prime Minister) faced in
governing an empire through statistics in the latter part of the 19th
century.</p>
<p>The quote lies, damned lies and statistics was also credited to
Benjamin Disraeli by Mark Twain in Twain’s autobiography.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> It
characterizes the idea that statistic can be made to prove anything. But
Disraeli died in 1881 and Mark Twain died in 1910. The important
breakthrough in overcoming our tendency to over-interpet data came with
the formalization of the field through the development of
<em>mathematical statistics</em>.</p>
<p>Data has an elusive quality, it promises so much but can deliver
little, it can mislead and misrepresent. To harness it, it must be
tamed. In Balfour and Disraeli’s time during the second half of the 19th
century, numbers and data were being accumulated, the social sciences
were being developed. There was a large-scale collection of data for the
purposes of government.</p>
<p>The modern ‘big data era’ is on the verge of delivering the same
sense of frustration that Balfour experienced, the early promise of big
data as a panacea is evolving to demands for delivery. For me,
personally, peak-hype coincided with an email I received inviting
collaboration on a project to deploy “<em>Big Data</em> and <em>Internet
of Things</em> in an <em>Industry 4.0</em> environment”. Further
questioning revealed that the actual project was optimization of the
efficiency of a manufacturing production line, a far more tangible and
<em>realizable</em> goal.</p>
<p>The antidote to this verbiage is found in increasing awareness. When
dealing with data the first trap to avoid is the games of buzzword bingo
that we are wont to play. The first goal is to quantify what challenges
can be addressed and what techniques are required. Behind the hype
fundamentals are changing. The phenomenon is about the increasing access
we have to data. The way customers’ information is recorded and
processes are codified and digitized with little overhead. Internet of
things is about the increasing number of cheap sensors that can be
easily interconnected through our modern network structures. But
businesses are about making money, and these phenomena need to be recast
in those terms before their value can be realized.</p>

(1857-1936), <a

truly be drawn from data. Their mathematical studies act as a restraint
on our tendency to over-interpret and see patterns where there are none.
They introduced concepts such as randomized control trials that form a
mainstay of our decision making today, from government, to clinicians to
large scale A/B testing that determines the nature of the web interfaces
we interact with on social media and shopping.</p>

<p>Their movement did the most to put statistics to rights, to eradicate
the ‘damned lies’. It was known as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_statistics">‘mathematical
statistics’</a>. Today I believe we should look to the emerging field of
<em>data science</em> to provide the same role. Data science is an
amalgam of statistics, data mining, computer systems, databases,
computation, machine learning and artificial intelligence. Spread across
these fields are the tools we need to realize data’s potential. For many
businesses this might be thought of as the challenge of ‘converting bits
into atoms’. Bits: the data stored on computer, atoms: the physical
manifestation of what we do; the transfer of goods, the delivery of
service. From fungible to tangible. When solving a challenge through
data there are a series of obstacles that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>Firstly, data awareness: what data you have and where its stored.
Sometimes this includes changing your conception of what data is and how
it can be obtained. From automated production lines to apps on employee
smart phones. Often data is locked away: manual logbooks, confidential
data, personal data. For increasing awareness an internal audit can
help. The website <a href="https://data.gov.uk/">data.gov.uk</a> hosts
data made available by the UK government. To create this website the
government’s departments went through an audit of what data they each
hold and what data they could make available. Similarly, within private
businesses this type of audit could be useful for understanding their
internal digital landscape: after all the key to any successful campaign
is a good map.</p>
<p>Secondly, availability. How well are the data sources interconnected?
How well curated are they? The curse of Disraeli was associated with
unreliable data and <em>unreliable statistics</em>. The
misrepresentations this leads to are worse than the absence of data as
they give a false sense of confidence to decision making. Understanding
how to avoid these pitfalls involves an improved sense of data and its
value, one that needs to permeate the organization.</p>
<p>The final challenge is analysis, the accumulation of the necessary
expertise to digest what the data tells us. Data requires
interpretation, and interpretation requires experience. Analysis is
providing a bottleneck due to a skill shortage, a skill shortage made
more acute by the fact that, ideally, analysis should be carried out by
individuals not only skilled in data science but also equipped with the
domain knowledge to understand the implications in a given application,
and to see opportunities for improvements in efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="mathematical-data-science">‘Mathematical Data Science’</h2>
<p>As a term ‘big data’ promises much and delivers little, to get true
value from data, it needs to be curated and evaluated. The three stages
of awareness, availability and analysis provide a broad framework
through which organizations should be assessing the potential in the
data they hold. Hand waving about big data solutions will not do, it
will only lead to self-deception. The castles we build on our data
landscapes must be based on firm foundations, process and scientific
analysis. If we do things right, those are the foundations that will be
provided by the new field of data science.</p>
<p>Today the statement “There are three types of lies: lies, damned lies
and ‘big data’” may be more apt. We are revisiting many of the mistakes
made in interpreting data from the 19th century. Big data is laid down
by happenstance, rather than actively collected with a particular
question in mind. That means it needs to be treated with care when
conclusions are being drawn. For data science to succeed it needs the
same form of rigor that Pearson and Fisher brought to statistics, a
“mathematical data science” is needed.</p>

<p>How could he do that? Well, first, they set up a mechanism where he
could scan across letters and blink at the letter he wanted to use. In
this way, he was able to write each letter.</p>
<p>It took him 10 months of four hours a day to write the book. Each
word took two minutes to write.</p>
<p>Imagine doing all that thinking, but so little speaking, having all
those thoughts and so little ability to communicate.</p>

<p>Figure: Embodiment factors are the ratio between our ability to
compute and our ability to communicate. Jean Dominique Bauby suffered
from locked-in syndrome. The embodiment factors show that relative to
the machine we are also locked in. In the table we represent embodiment
as the length of time it would take to communicate one second’s worth of
computation. For computers it is a matter of minutes, but for a human,
whether locked in or not, it is a matter of many millions of years.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Let me explain what I mean. Claude Shannon introduced a mathematical
concept of information for the purposes of understanding telephone
exchanges.</p>
<p>Information has many meanings, but mathematically, Shannon defined a
bit of information to be the amount of information you get from tossing
a coin.</p>
<p>If I toss a coin, and look at it, I know the answer. You don’t. But
if I now tell you the answer I communicate to you 1 bit of information.
Shannon defined this as the fundamental unit of information.</p>
<p>If I toss the coin twice, and tell you the result of both tosses, I
give you two bits of information. Information is additive.</p>
<p>Shannon also estimated the average information associated with the
English language. He estimated that the average information in any word
is 12 bits, equivalent to twelve coin tosses.</p>
<p>So every two minutes Bauby was able to communicate 12 bits, or six
bits per minute.</p>
<p>This is the information transfer rate he was limited to, the rate at
which he could communicate.</p>
<p>Compare this to me, talking now. The average speaker for TEDX speaks
around 160 words per minute. That’s 320 times faster than Bauby or
around a 2000 bits per minute. 2000 coin tosses per minute.</p>
<p>But, just think how much thought Bauby was putting into every
sentence. Imagine how carefully chosen each of his words was. Because he
was communication constrained he could put more thought into each of his
words. Into thinking about his audience.</p>
<p>So, his intelligence became locked in. He thinks as fast as any of
us, but can communicate slower. Like the tree falling in the woods with
no one there to hear it, his intelligence is embedded inside him.</p>
<p>Two thousand coin tosses per minute sounds pretty impressive, but
this talk is not just about us, it’s about our computers, and the type
of intelligence we are creating within them.</p>
<p>So how does two thousand compare to our digital companions? When
computers talk to each other, they do so with billions of coin tosses
per minute.</p>
<p>Let’s imagine for a moment, that instead of talking about
communication of information, we are actually talking about money. Bauby
would have 6 dollars. I would have 2000 dollars, and my computer has
billions of dollars.</p>
<p>The internet has interconnected computers and equipped them with
extremely high transfer rates.</p>
<p>However, by our very best estimates, computers actually think slower
than us.</p>
<p>How can that be? You might ask, computers calculate much faster than
me. That’s true, but underlying your conscious thoughts there are a lot
of calculations going on.</p>
<p>Each thought involves many thousands, millions or billions of
calculations. How many exactly, we don’t know yet, because we don’t know
how the brain turns calculations into thoughts.</p>
<p>Our best estimates suggest that to simulate your brain a computer
would have to be as large as the UK Met Office machine here in Exeter.
That’s a 250 million pound machine, the fastest in the UK. It can do 16
billion billon calculations per second.</p>
<p>It simulates the weather across the word every day, that’s how much
power we think we need to simulate our brains.</p>
<p>So, in terms of our computational power we are extraordinary, but in
terms of our ability to explain ourselves, just like Bauby, we are
locked in.</p>
<p>For a typical computer, to communicate everything it computes in one
second, it would only take it a couple of minutes. For us to do the same
would take 15 billion years.</p>
<p>If intelligence is fundamentally about processing and sharing of
information. This gives us a fundamental constraint on human
intelligence that dictates its nature.</p>
<p>I call this ratio between the time it takes to compute something, and
the time it takes to say it, the embodiment factor <span
class="citation" data-cites="Lawrence:embodiment17">(Lawrence,
2017a)</span>. Because it reflects how embodied our cognition is.</p>
<p>If it takes you two minutes to say the thing you have thought in a
second, then you are a computer. If it takes you 15 billion years, then
you are a human.</p>

<p>Figure: Misunderstanding of context and who we are talking to leads
to arguments.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Embodiment factors imply that, in our communication between humans,
what is <em>not</em> said is, perhaps, more important than what is said.
To communicate with each other we need to have a model of who each of us
are.</p>
<p>To aid this, in society, we are required to perform roles. Whether as
a parent, a teacher, an employee or a boss. Each of these roles requires
that we conform to certain standards of behaviour to facilitate
communication between ourselves.</p>
<p>Control of self is vitally important to these communications.</p>
<p>The high availability of data available to humans undermines
human-to-human communication channels by providing new routes to
undermining our control of self.</p>
<p>The consequences between this mismatch of power and delivery are to
be seen all around us. Because, just as driving an F1 car with bicycle
wheels would be a fine art, so is the process of communication between
humans.</p>
<p>If I have a thought and I wish to communicate it, I first need to
have a model of what you think. I should think before I speak. When I
speak, you may react. You have a model of who I am and what I was trying
to say, and why I chose to say what I said. Now we begin this dance,
where we are each trying to better understand each other and what we are
saying. When it works, it is beautiful, but when mis-deployed, just like
a badly driven F1 car, there is a horrible crash, an argument.</p>

<p>Similarly, we find it difficult to comprehend how computers are
making decisions. Because they do so with more data than we can possibly
imagine.</p>
<p>In many respects, this is not a problem, it’s a good thing. Computers
and us are good at different things. But when we interact with a
computer, when it acts in a different way to us, we need to remember
why.</p>
<p>Just as the first step to getting along with other humans is
understanding other humans, so it needs to be with getting along with
our computers.</p>
<p>Embodiment factors explain why, at the same time, computers are so
impressive in simulating our weather, but so poor at predicting our
moods. Our complexity is greater than that of our weather, and each of
us is tuned to read and respond to one another.</p>
<p>Their intelligence is different. It is based on very large quantities
of data that we cannot absorb. Our computers don’t have a complex
internal model of who we are. They don’t understand the human condition.
They are not tuned to respond to us as we are to each other.</p>
<p>Embodiment factors encapsulate a profound thing about the nature of
humans. Our locked in intelligence means that we are striving to
communicate, so we put a lot of thought into what we’re communicating
with. And if we’re communicating with something complex, we naturally
anthropomorphize them.</p>
<p>We give our dogs, our cats, and our cars human motivations. We do the
same with our computers. We anthropomorphize them. We assume that they
have the same objectives as us and the same constraints. They don’t.</p>
<p>This means, that when we worry about artificial intelligence, we
worry about the wrong things. We fear computers that behave like more
powerful versions of ourselves that will struggle to outcompete us.</p>
<p>In reality, the challenge is that our computers cannot be human
enough. They cannot understand us with the depth we understand one
another. They drop below our cognitive radar and operate outside our
mental models.</p>
<p>The real danger is that computers don’t anthropomorphize. They’ll
make decisions in isolation from us without our supervision because they
can’t communicate truly and deeply with us.</p>

<p>The high bandwidth of computers has resulted in a close relationship
between the computer and data. Large amounts of information can flow
between the two. The degree to which the computer is mediating our
relationship with data means that we should consider it an
intermediary.</p>
<p>Originally our low bandwidth relationship with data was affected by
two characteristics. Firstly, our tendency to over-interpret driven by
our need to extract as much knowledge from our low bandwidth information
channel as possible. Secondly, by our improved understanding of the
domain of <em>mathematical</em> statistics and how our cognitive biases
can mislead us.</p>
<p>With this new set up there is a potential for assimilating far more
information via the computer, but the computer can present this to us in
various ways. If its motives are not aligned with ours then it can
misrepresent the information. This needn’t be nefarious it can be simply
because of the computer pursuing a different objective from us. For
example, if the computer is aiming to maximize our interaction time that
may be a different objective from ours which may be to summarize
information in a representative manner in the <em>shortest</em> possible
length of time.</p>
<p>For example, for me, it was a common experience to pick up my
telephone with the intention of checking when my next appointment was,
but to soon find myself distracted by another application on the phone
and end up reading something on the internet. By the time I’d finished
reading, I would often have forgotten the reason I picked up my phone in
the first place.</p>
<p>There are great benefits to be had from the huge amount of
information we can unlock from this evolved relationship between us and
data. In biology, large scale data sharing has been driven by a
revolution in genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic measurement. The
improved inferences that can be drawn through summarizing data by
computer have fundamentally changed the nature of biological science,
now this phenomenon is also influencing us in our daily lives as data
measured by <em>happenstance</em> is increasingly used to characterize
us.</p>
<p>Better mediation of this flow requires a better understanding of
human-computer interaction. This in turn involves understanding our own
intelligence better, what its cognitive biases are and how these might
mislead us.</p>

<p>Classically the field of statistics focused on mediating the
relationship between the machine and the human. Our limited bandwidth of
communication means we tend to over-interpret the limited information
that we are given, in the extreme we assign motives and desires to
inanimate objects (a process known as anthropomorphizing). Much of
mathematical statistics was developed to help temper this tendency and
understand when we are valid in drawing conclusions from data.</p>

modern phenomenon. The communication channel between computer and data

computer. The focus on classical statistics reflected the importance of
the direct communication between human and data. The modern challenges
of data science emerge when that relationship is being mediated by the
machine.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Data science brings new challenges. In particular, there is a very
large bandwidth connection between the machine and data. This means that
our relationship with data is now commonly being mediated by the
machine. Whether this is in the acquisition of new data, which now
happens by happenstance rather than with purpose, or the interpretation
of that data where we are increasingly relying on machines to summarize
what the data contains. This is leading to the emerging field of data
science, which must not only deal with the same challenges that
mathematical statistics faced in tempering our tendency to over
interpret data but must also deal with the possibility that the machine
has either inadvertently or maliciously misrepresented the underlying
data.</p>
<p>With new capabilities becoming available through very large
generational AI models, we can imagine different interfaces with that
information, but the potential for manipulation is if anything even
greater.</p>

<p>One challenge for existing information technology professionals is
realizing the extent to which a software ecosystem based on data differs
from a classical ecosystem. In particular, by ingesting data we bring
unknowns/uncontrollables into our decision-making system. This presents
opportunity for adversarial exploitation and unforeseen operation.</p>
<p>blog post on <a
href="http://inverseprobability.com/2017/03/14/data-science-as-debugging">Data
Science as Debugging</a>.</p>
<p>Starting with the analysis of a data set, the nature of data science
is somewhat difference from classical software engineering.</p>
<p>One analogy I find helpful for understanding the depth of change we
need is the following. Imagine as a software engineer, you find a USB
stick on the ground. And for some reason you <em>know</em> that on that
USB stick is a particular API call that will enable you to make a
significant positive difference on a business problem. You don’t know
which of the many library functions on the USB stick are the ones that
will help. And it could be that some of those library functions will
hinder, perhaps because they are just inappropriate or perhaps because
they have been placed there maliciously. The most secure thing to do
would be to <em>not</em> introduce this code into your production system
at all. But what if your manager told you to do so, how would you go
about incorporating this code base?</p>
<p>The answer is <em>very</em> carefully. You would have to engage in a
process more akin to debugging than regular software engineering. As you
understood the code base, for your work to be reproducible, you should
be documenting it, not just what you discovered, but how you discovered
it. In the end, you typically find a single API call that is the one
that most benefits your system. But more thought has been placed into
this line of code than any line of code you have written before.</p>
<p>An enormous amount of debugging would be required. As the nature of
the code base is understood, software tests to verify it also need to be
constructed. At the end of all your work, the lines of software you
write to interact with the software on the USB stick are likely to be
minimal. But more thought would be put into those lines than perhaps any
other lines of code in the system.</p>
<p>Even then, when your API code is introduced into your production
system, it needs to be deployed in an environment that monitors it. We
cannot rely on an individual’s decision making to ensure the quality of
all our systems. We need to create an environment that includes quality
controls, checks, and bounds, tests, all designed to ensure that
assumptions made about this foreign code base are remaining valid.</p>
<p>This situation is akin to what we are doing when we incorporate data
in our production systems. When we are consuming data from others, we
cannot assume that it has been produced in alignment with our goals for
our own systems. Worst case, it may have been adversarially produced. A
further challenge is that data is dynamic. So, in effect, the code on
the USB stick is evolving over time.</p>
<p>It might see that this process is easy to formalize now, we simply
need to check what the formal software engineering process is for
debugging, because that is the current software engineering activity
that data science is closest to. But when we look for a formalization of
debugging, we find that there is none. Indeed, modern software
engineering mainly focusses on ensuring that code is written without
bugs in the first place.</p>
<h3 id="lessons">Lessons</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>When you begin an analysis, behave as a debugger.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Write test code as you go. Document those tests and ensure they are
accessible by others.</li>
<li>Understand the landscape of your data. Be prepared to try several
different approaches to the data set.</li>
<li>Be constantly skeptical.</li>
<li>Use the best tools available, develop a deep understand how they
work.</li>
<li>Share your experience of what challenges you’re facing. Have others
(software engineers, fellow data analysts, your manager) review your
work.</li>
<li>Never go straight for the goal: you’d never try and write the API
call straight away on the discarded hard drive, so why are you launching
your classification algorithm before visualizing the data?</li>
<li>Ensure your analysis is documented and accessible. If your code does
go wrong in production, you’ll need to be able to retrace to where the
error crept in.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>When managing the data science process, don’t treat it as standard
code development.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Don’t deploy a traditional agile development pipeline and expect it
to work the same way it does for standard code development. Think about
how you handle bugs, think about how you would handle very many
bugs.</li>
<li>Don’t leave the data scientist alone to wade through the mess.</li>
<li>Integrate the data analysis with your other team activities. Have
the software engineers and domain experts work closely with the data
scientists. This is vital for providing the data scientists with the
technical support they need, but also managing the expectations of the
engineers in terms of when and how the data will be able to
deliver.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Anecdotally, resolving a machine
learning challenge requires 80% of the resource to be focused on the
data and perhaps 20% to be focused on the model. But many companies are
too keen to employ machine learning engineers who focus on the models,
not the data. We should change our hiring priorities and training.
Universities cannot provide the understanding of how to data-wrangle.
Companies must fill this gap.</p>

<p>Here we present a new framework for thinking about data science. The
Fynesse framework splits the activities of the data scientist into three
aspects, each aspect is represented by a one of three words that
highlight different activities that occur within a data science project:
we call them access, assess and address.</p>

looking at some other formalizations of the data analysis pipeline.</p>

<p>We note that the term <em>data mining</em> is falling somewhat out of
favour, and the CRISP-DM data mining process also feels somewhat dated.
In particular software engineering has moved on a great deal since it
was defined, with modern software engineering more focused on
service-oriented architectures. Software design has a pervasive effect
on our ability to do data science.</p>
<p>When thinking about the data science process it is important to
consider the <em>software architectures</em> that are used in
large-scale decision-making systems and understand what it is that they
are bring to help solve these problems.</p>
<p>A more modern view from the O’Reilly book <em>Doing Data Science</em>
frames the problem as shown in Figure <span
class="math inline">\(\ref{data-science-process-oneil}\)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More generally, a data scientist is someone who knows how to extract
meaning from and interpret data, which requires both tools and methods
from statistics and machine learning, as well as being human. She spends
a lot of time in the process of collecting, cleaning, and munging data,
because data is never clean. This process requires persistence,
statistics, and software engineering skills—skills that are also
necessary for understanding biases in the data, and for debugging
logging output from code.</p>

<p>One thing about working in an industrial environment, is the way that
short-term thinking actions become important. For example, in Formula
One, the teams are working on a two-week cycle to digest information
from the previous week’s race and incorporate updates to the car or
their strategy.</p>
<p>However, businesses must also think about more medium-term horizons.
For example, in Formula 1 you need to worry about next year’s car. So,
while you’re working on updating this year’s car, you also need to think
about what will happen for next year and prioritize these conflicting
needs appropriately.</p>
<p>In the Amazon supply chain, there are equivalent demands. If we
accept that an artificial intelligence is just an automated
decision-making system. And if we measure in terms of money
automatically spent, or goods automatically moved, then Amazon’s buying
system is perhaps the world’s largest AI.</p>
<p>Those decisions are being made on short time schedules; purchases are
made by the system on weekly cycles. But just as in Formula 1, there is
also a need to think about what needs to be done next month, next
quarter and next year. Planning meetings are held not only on a weekly
basis (known as weekly business reviews), but monthly, quarterly, and
then yearly meetings for planning spends and investments.</p>
<p>Amazon is known for being longer term thinking than many companies,
and a lot of this is coming from the CEO. One quote from Jeff Bezos that
stuck with me was the following.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I very frequently get the question: ‘What’s going to change in the
next 10 years?’ And that is a very interesting question; it’s a very
common one. I almost never get the question: ‘What’s not going to change
in the next 10 years?’ And I submit to you that that second question is
actually the more important of the two – because you can build a
business strategy around the things that are stable in time. … [I]n our
retail business, we know that customers want low prices, and I know
that’s going to be true 10 years from now. They want fast delivery; they
want vast selection. It’s impossible to imagine a future 10 years from
now where a customer comes up and says, ‘Jeff I love Amazon; I just wish
the prices were a little higher,’ [or] ‘I love Amazon; I just wish you’d
deliver a little more slowly.’ Impossible. And so the effort we put into
those things, spinning those things up, we know the energy we put into
it today will still be paying off dividends for our customers 10 years
from now. When you have something that you know is true, even over the
long term, you can afford to put a lot of energy into it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote is incredibly important for long term thinking. Indeed,
it’s a failure of many of our simulations that they focus on what is
going to happen, not what will not happen. In Amazon, this meant that
there was constant focus on these three areas, keeping costs low, making
delivery fast and improving selection. For example, shortly before I
left Amazon moved its entire US network from two-day delivery to one-day
delivery. This involves changing the way the entire buying system
operates. Or, more recently, the company has had to radically change the
portfolio of products it buys in the face of Covid19.</p>
<!--These challenges are not just there for Amazon and Formula 1. In Sheffield, we worked closely with a Chesterfield based company called Fusion Group. They make joints that fuse PTFE pipes together. These pipes are used for transporting both water and gas. Their founder, Eric Bridgstock, was an engineer who introduced PTFE piping to the UK when working for DuPont. Eric set up Fusion group to manufacture the fusion fittings. Because PTFE pipes carry water or gas at high pressure, when these fittings fail significant damage can occur. When these fittings were originally installed in the early 1980s, the job was done by a specialist, but nowadays the pipe weld is compelted by the same team that digs the hole. While costs have come down, the number of PTFE weld failures went up. Eric's company focussed on new systems for auto-->

<p>From the perspective of the team that we had in the supply chain, we
looked at what we most needed to focus on. Amazon moves very quickly,
but we could also take a leaf out of Jeff’s book, and instead of
worrying about what was going to change, remember what wasn’t going to
change.</p>

we won’t want slower experiments, we won’t want more expensive

<p>In data driven decision-making systems, the quality of
decision-making is determined by the quality of the data. We need to
extend the notion of <em>service</em>-oriented architecture to
<em>data</em>-oriented architecture (DOA).</p>
<p>The focus in SOA is eliminating <em>hard</em> failures. Hard failures
can occur due to bugs or systems overload. This notion needs to be
extended in ML systems to capture <em>soft failures</em> associated with
declining data quality, incorrect modeling assumptions and inappropriate
re-deployments of models. We need to focus on data quality assessments.
In data-oriented architectures engineering teams are responsible for the
<em>quality</em> of their output data streams in addition to the
<em>availability</em> of the service they support <span class="citation"
data-cites="Lawrence-drl17">(Lawrence, 2017b)</span>. Quality here is
not just accuracy, but fairness and explainability. This important
cultural change would be capable of addressing both the challenge of
<em>technical debt</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="Sculley:debt15">(Sculley et al., 2015)</span> and the social
responsibility of ML systems.</p>
<p>Software development proceeds with a <em>test-oriented</em> culture.
One where tests are written before software, and software is not
incorporated in the wider system until all tests pass. We must apply the
same standards of care to our ML systems, although for ML we need
statistical tests for quality, fairness, and consistency within the
environment. Fortunately, the main burden of this testing need not fall
to the engineers themselves: through leveraging <em>classical
statistics</em> and <em>emulation</em> we will automate the creation and
redeployment of these tests across the software ecosystem, we call this
<em>ML hypervision</em>.</p>
<p>Modern AI can be based on ML models with many millions of parameters,
trained on very large data sets. In ML, strong emphasis is placed on
<em>predictive accuracy</em> whereas sister-fields such as statistics
have a strong emphasis on <em>interpretability</em>. ML models are said
to be ‘black boxes’ which make decisions that are not explainable.<a

<p>Figure: Data-oriented programing. There is a requirement for an
estimate of the driver allocation to give a rough cost estimate before
the user has confirmed the ride. In data-oriented programming, this is
achieved through declaring a hypothetical stream which approximates the
true driver allocation, but with restricted input information and
constraints on the computational latency.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>For the ride sharing system, we start to see a common issue with a
more complex algorithmic decision-making system. Several decisions are
being made multiple times. Let’s look at the decisions we need along
with some design criteria.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Driver Availability: Estimate time to arrival for Anne’s ride using
Anne’s location and local available car locations. Latency 50
milliseconds</li>
<li>Cost Estimate: Estimate cost for journey using Anne’s destination,
location and local available car current destinations and availability.
Latency 50 milliseconds</li>
<li>Driver Allocation: Allocate car to minimize transport cost to
destination. Latency 2 seconds.</li>
</ol>
<p>So we need:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>a hypothetical to estimate availability. It is constrained by
lacking destination information and a low latency requirement.</li>
<li>a hypothetical to estimate cost. It is constrained by low latency
requirement and</li>
</ol>
<p>Simultaneously, drivers in this data ecosystem have an app which
notifies them about new jobs and recommends them where to go.</p>
<p>Further advantages. Strategies for data retention (when to snapshot)
can be set globally.</p>
<p>A few decisions need to be made in this system. First of all, when
the user opens the app, the estimate of the time to the nearest ride may
need to be computed quickly, to avoid latency in the service.</p>
<p>This may require a quick estimate of the ride availability.</p>

<p>Arguably the challenges for automated data science and deploying
complex machine learning solutions are similar. The AutoAI project at
Cambridge is focussed on maintaining and explaining machine learning
systems. The assumption is that such systems are generally made up of
interacting components that make decisions in a composite manner. They
have interfaces to the real world where that data is collected, but they
also generate data within themselves. The challenge of collecting data
is sometimes less the challenge of pacing the streets and more the
challenge of extracting it from existing systems.</p>
<h2 id="the-fynesse-framework-1">The Fynesse Framework</h2>
<p>The Fynesse paradigm considers three <em>aspects</em> to data
analysis: Access, Assess, Address. In this way it builds on many two
stage processes that consider <em>data collection</em> and <em>data
wrangling</em> to be two separate stages. There are two key differences
to the Fynesse process. Firstly, the attempt to separate data wrangling
tasks into (a) those that can be done <em>without</em> knowing the
downstream task (Assess) and (b) those that can only be done
<em>with</em> knowing the downstream task (Address). Naturally, this
won’t turn out to be a clean separation. But the ethos is to ensure that
any reusable tasks that is done in the process of data wrangling is
labelled as such and pushed back into the data ecosystem. Secondly, our
use of the term <em>aspects</em> instead of stages acknowledges the fact
that although there is a natural ordering to the aspects, we find that
in practice the data scientist is often moving quickly across the
different aspects, so that the mind set of “stages” can be
unhelpful.</p>
<h2 id="access">Access</h2>
<p>The first aspect we’ll consider is <em>accessing</em> the data.
Depending on domain, the skills needed to address this challenge will
vary greatly. For example, <a
href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/people/academic/michael-smith">Michael
T. Smith</a> was leading a project in collaboration with the Kampala
police force to collate accident data.</p>
<p>The <em>access</em> aspect is associated with data readiness level C
(<span class="citation" data-cites="Lawrence-drl17">Lawrence

<p>Figure: Crash Map Kampala was an initiative by Michael T. Smith and
Bagonza Jimmy Owa Kinyonyi to map the location, date and severity of
vehicle accidents across the city of Kampala. Original storage location

<p>The project is work from <a

<p>The project was inspired by the observation that road traffic
accidents are a leading cause of death for the young in many contexts,
but the scale of the cause is difficult to compare directly because the
number of deaths and serious injuries are difficult to access.</p>
<p>In Kampala this data is stored in logbooks at local police stations.
Jimmy was in the Kampala police at the time, so the project focus was
transcribing this information into a digital format where it could be
mapped.</p>
<p>Due to the scale of the task, the approach of crowd sourcing the work
was considered. This approach was also what launched the AI revolution
through the ImageNet challenge, where data was labelled through
Mechanical Turk (<span class="citation"

<p>But there are additional challenges with this data. The logbooks are
typically accessed only by members of Kampala’s police force, in their
recording of the accidents. So, permission from the police force was
important. Additionally, personal information about those involved in
the accidents might have been revealed in the process of crowdsourcing
the work.</p>

<p>It seems a great challenge to automate all the different aspects of
the process of data access, but this challenge is underway already
through the process of what is commonly called <em>digital
transformation</em>. The process of digital transformation takes data
away from physical logbooks and into digital devices. But that
transformation process itself comes with challenges. For example, the
Kampala police force is not currently equipped to store this data in
purely digital form. It would require not only devices (which many
officers <em>will</em> have access to) but a system of backup and
storage that is beyond the capabilities of many organisations.</p>
<p>Legal complications around data are still a major barrier though. In
the EU and the US database schema and indices are subject to copyright
law. Companies making data available often require license fees. As many
data sources are combined, the composite effect of the different license
agreements often makes the legal challenges insurmountable. This was a
common challenge in the pandemic, where academics who could deal with
complex data predictions were excluded from data access due to
challenges around licensing. A nice counter example was the work led by
Nuria Oliver in Spain who after a call to arms in a national newspaper
(<span class="citation" data-cites="Oliver-valor20">Oliver
(2020)</span>) was able to bring the ecosystem together around mobility
data.</p>
<p>However, even when organisation is fully digital, and license issues
are overcome, there are issues around how the data is managed stored,
accessed. The discoverability of the data and the recording of its
provenance are too often neglected in the process of digital
transformation. Further, once an organisation has gone through digital
transformation, they begin making predictions around the data. These
predictions are data themselves, and their presence in the data
ecosystem needs recording. Automating this portion requires structured
thinking around our data ecosystems.</p>
<h2 id="assess">Assess</h2>
<p>Data that is accessible can be imported (via APIs or database calls
or reading a CSV) into the machine and work can be done understanding
the nature of the data. The important thing to say about the assess
aspect is that it only includes things you can do <em>without</em> the
question in mind. This runs counter to many ideas about how we do data
analytics. The history of statistics was that we think of the question
<em>before</em> we collect data. But that was because data was
expensive, and it needed to be explicitly collected. The same mantra is
true today of <em>surveillance data</em>. But the new challenge is
around <em>happenstance data</em>, data that is cheaply available but
may be of poor quality. The nature of the data needs to be understood
before its integrated into analysis. Unfortunately, because the work is
conflated with other aspects, decisions are sometimes made during
assessment (for example approaches to imputing missing values) which may
be useful in one context, but are useless in others. So the aim in
<em>assess</em> is to only do work that is repeatable, and make that
work available to others who may also want to use the data.</p>
<p>The assess aspect renders the Fynesse framework quite different form
other data science frameworks that split the process into data
<em>wrangling</em> and data <em>modelling</em>. It acknowledges that
there is a component to both wrangling and modelling that is specific to
the task (this occurs in the <em>address</em> aspect) and a component
that is useful across tasks (the <em>assess</em> aspect). This is
important in the wider system because any reusable work can be shared.
By keeping this uppermost in the mind through the <em>assess</em>
aspect, then the wider data ecosystem benefits.</p>
<p>The <em>assess</em> aspect is associated with data readiness level B
(<span class="citation" data-cites="Lawrence-drl17">Lawrence

Joyce onto the Access, Assess, Address paradigm.</p>
<p>The aim of the project is to develop tools for automated

Social media posts are invalid, inaccurate, potentially harmful. This is

<p>One challenge for this project is dealing with a data set with
multiple languages. In Uganda, people don’t just communicate in English,
but they will <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code-switching">code-switch</a> or
communicate purely in, e.g. Luganda. Tools and resources for dealing
with code-switching or the Lugandan language in NLP are much less common
than tools for dealing with high resource languages (e.g. German,
English, French, Spanish, Mandarin). See <span class="citation"
data-cites="Magueresse-lowresource20">Magueresse et al. (2020)</span>
for a review of NLP in low resource languages, multilingual data sets
bring their own problems <span class="citation"
data-cites="Aman-dataset20">Aman Ullah et al. (2020)</span>.</p>
<p>The Luganda language is the most widely spoken indigenous language in
Uganda with more than seven million speakers. By definition, a low
resourced language has less capabilities for data annotation and
augmentation, e.g. part of speech taggers.</p>
<h2 id="data-access">Data Access</h2>
<p>The social media data was collected from a set of pages (media
institutions, ministry of health, media personalities, top
twitter/facebook users from Uganda. All data was then filtered using
keywords, ‘ssenyiga’, ‘kolona’, ‘corona’ ,‘virus’ ,‘obulwadde’,
‘corona’, ‘covid’, ‘abalwadde’, ‘ekirwadde’, ‘akawuka’, ‘staysafeug’,
‘stayhome’, ‘tonsemberera’, ‘tokwatakudereva’, ‘vaccine’ to select with
Covid-19 related tweets. Very short Facebook posts were also removed.
Data was collected in two phases, from March 2020 - March 2021 and then
from June 2021 - August 2021. Raw data points 15,354 posts from twitter
and 430,075 from Facebook.</p>
<p>Note that in this case, knowledge of the question has been used in
accessing the data. The context of the data is Uganda and the focus is
Covid-19. That focus is driven by the pandemic. However, as we see when
we get to data assessment, there is still an amount of reusable work
that could/should be automated.</p>
<h2 id="data-assessment">Data Assessment</h2>
<p>After collecting data, the initial assessment was formed to
understand the data, uncover patterns and gain insights. Here various

<h2 id="automating-assess">Automating Assess</h2>
<p>There are lots of interesting projects around automating the
assessment of the data, for example one can consider automation of
schema and data type detection (<span class="citation"
data-cites="Valera-automatic17">Valera and Ghahramani (2017)</span>) or
the AI for Data Analytics Project (see <span class="citation"
data-cites="Nazabal-engineering20">Nazábal et al. (2020)</span> for an
overview of issues and case studies and the video in Figure <span
class="math inline">\(\ref{ai-for-data-analytics}\)</span> for details
on the project). We may even view projects like the automatic
statistician as automating of assessment (<span class="citation"
data-cites="Lloyd-automatic14">James Robert Lloyd and Ghahramani.
(2014)</span>), although arguably one could suggest that the choice of
data set used in those projects itself is reflective of the
<em>question</em> or <em>context</em>. This highlights the difficulty in
separating the aspects. The key quesiton to ask in any given context is
whether the augmentation you are performing for the data set is going to
be helpful or a hindrance to those that may wish to reuse your data.</p>

<h2 id="address">Address</h2>
<p>The final aspect of the process is to <em>address</em> the question.
We’ll spend the least time on this aspect here, because it’s the one
that is most widely formally taught and the one that most researchers
are familiar with. In statistics, this might involve some confirmatory
data analysis. In machine learning it may involve designing a predictive
model. In many domains it will involve figuring out how best to
visualise the data to present it to those who need to make the
decisions. That could involve a dashboard, a plot or even summarisation
in an Excel spreadsheet.</p>
<p>The <em>address</em> aspect is associated with data readiness level A
(<span class="citation" data-cites="Lawrence-drl17">Lawrence
(2017b)</span>).</p>
<h2 id="automating-address">Automating Address</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most widespread approach to automating the address aspect
is known as AutoML (see video in Figure <span
class="math inline">\(\ref{frank-hutter-automl}\)</span>). This is an
automatic approach to creating ML prediction models. The automatic
statistician we mentioned in assess also has some of these goals in mind
for automating confirmatory data analysis. But there are clearly other
aspects we may wish to automate, particularly around visualization.</p>

<p>Recent breakthroughs in generative models, particularly large
language models, have enabled machines that, for the first time, can
converse plausibly with other humans.</p>
<p>The Apollo guidance computer provided Armstrong with an analogy when
he landed it on the Moon. He controlled it through a stick which
provided him with an analogy. The analogy is based in the experience
that Amelia Earhart had when she flew her plane. Armstrong’s control
exploited his experience as a test pilot flying planes that had control
columns which were directly connected to their control surfaces.</p>

<p>The generative systems we have produced do not provide us with the
“AI” of science fiction. Because their intelligence is based on
emulating human knowledge. Through being forced to reproduce our
literature and our art they have developed aspects which are analogous
to the cultural proxy truths we use to describe our world.</p>
<p>These machines are to humans what the MONIAC was the British economy.

<p>Of course this route provides new routes for manipulation, new ways
in which the machine can undermine our autonomy or exploit our cognitive
foibles. The major challenge we face is steering between these worlds
where we gain the advantage of the computer’s bandwidth without
undermining our culture and individual autonomy.</p>
