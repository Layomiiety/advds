<p>begin by examining three key challenges: bias, complexity and
intellectual debt. Each of these challenges impacts solution deployment,
maintenance and interpretability.</p>
<p>We emphasise that while model development is an important part of the
pipeline, focussing only on model accuracy can cause us to overlook
real-world deployment challenges.</p>
