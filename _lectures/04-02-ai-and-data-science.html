<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Data science is an emerging discipline. That makes it harder to make
clean decisions about what any given individual will need to know to
become a data scientist. Those of you who are studying now will be those
that define the discipline. As we deploy more data driven decision
making in the world, the role will be refined. Until we achieve that
refinement, your knowledge needs to be broad based.</p>
<p>In this lecture we will first continue our theme of how our
limitations as humans mean that our analysis of data can be affected,
and I will introduce an analogy that should help you understand
<em>how</em> data science differs significantly from traditional
software engineering.</p>

<p>Machine learning allows us to extract knowledge from data to form a
prediction.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{data} + \text{model}
\stackrel{\text{compute}}{\rightarrow} \text{prediction}\]</span></p>
<p>A machine learning prediction is made by combining a model with data
to form the prediction. The manner in which this is done gives us the
machine learning <em>algorithm</em>.</p>
<p>Machine learning models are <em>mathematical models</em> which make
weak assumptions about data, e.g. smoothness assumptions. By combining
these assumptions with the data, we observe we can interpolate between
data points or, occasionally, extrapolate into the future.</p>
<p>Machine learning is a technology which strongly overlaps with the
methodology of statistics. From a historical/philosophical view point,
machine learning differs from statistics in that the focus in the
machine learning community has been primarily on accuracy of prediction,
whereas the focus in statistics is typically on the interpretability of
a model and/or validating a hypothesis through data collection.</p>
<p>The rapid increase in the availability of compute and data has led to
the increased prominence of machine learning. This prominence is
surfacing in two different but overlapping domains: data science and
artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>The real challenge, however, is end-to-end decision making. Taking

<h2 id="classical-statistical-analysis">Classical Statistical
Analysis</h2>
<p>Despite the shift of emphasis, traditional statistical techniques are
more important than ever. One of the few ways we have to validate the
analyses we create is to make use of visualizations, randomized testing
and other forms of statistical analysis. You will have explored some of
these ideas in earlier courses in machine learning. In this unit we
provide some review material in a practical sheet to bring some of those
ideas together in the context of data science.</p>

<p>What is machine learning? At its most basic level machine learning is
a combination of</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{data} + \text{model}
\stackrel{\text{compute}}{\rightarrow} \text{prediction}\]</span></p>
<p>where <em>data</em> is our observations. They can be actively or
passively acquired (meta-data). The <em>model</em> contains our
assumptions, based on previous experience. That experience can be other
data, it can come from transfer learning, or it can merely be our
beliefs about the regularities of the universe. In humans our models
include our inductive biases. The <em>prediction</em> is an action to be
taken or a categorization or a quality score. The reason that machine
learning has become a mainstay of artificial intelligence is the
importance of predictions in artificial intelligence. The data and the
model are combined through computation.</p>
<p>In practice we normally perform machine learning using two functions.
To combine data with a model we typically make use of:</p>
<p><strong>a prediction function</strong> it is used to make the
predictions. It includes our beliefs about the regularities of the
universe, our assumptions about how the world works, e.g., smoothness,
spatial similarities, temporal similarities.</p>
<p><strong>an objective function</strong> it defines the ‘cost’ of
misprediction. Typically, it includes knowledge about the world’s
generating processes (probabilistic objectives) or the costs we pay for
mispredictions (empirical risk minimization).</p>
<p>The combination of data and model through the prediction function and
the objective function leads to a <em>learning algorithm</em>. The class
of prediction functions and objective functions we can make use of is
restricted by the algorithms they lead to. If the prediction function or
the objective function are too complex, then it can be difficult to find
an appropriate learning algorithm. Much of the academic field of machine
learning is the quest for new learning algorithms that allow us to bring
different types of models and data together.</p>

<p>Machine learning technologies have been the driver of two related,
but distinct disciplines. The first is <em>data science</em>. Data
science is an emerging field that arises from the fact that we now
collect so much data by happenstance, rather than by <em>experimental
design</em>. Classical statistics is the science of drawing conclusions
from data, and to do so statistical experiments are carefully designed.
In the modern era we collect so much data that there’s a desire to draw
inferences directly from the data.</p>
<p>As well as machine learning, the field of data science draws from
statistics, cloud computing, data storage (e.g. streaming data),
visualization and data mining.</p>
<p>In contrast, artificial intelligence technologies typically focus on
emulating some form of human behaviour, such as understanding an image,
or some speech, or translating text from one form to another. The recent
advances in artificial intelligence have come from machine learning
providing the automation. But in contrast to data science, in artificial
intelligence the data is normally collected with the specific task in
mind. In this sense it has strong relations to classical statistics.</p>
<p>Classically artificial intelligence worried more about <em>logic</em>
and <em>planning</em> and focused less on data driven decision making.
Modern machine learning owes more to the field of <em>Cybernetics</em>
<span class="citation" data-cites="Wiener-cybernetics48">(Wiener,
1948)</span> than artificial intelligence. Related fields include
<em>robotics</em>, <em>speech recognition</em>, <em>language
understanding</em> and <em>computer vision</em>.</p>
<p>There are strong overlaps between the fields, the wide availability
of data by happenstance makes it easier to collect data for designing AI
systems. These relations are coming through wide availability of sensing
technologies that are interconnected by cellular networks, WiFi and the
internet. This phenomenon is sometimes known as the <em>Internet of
Things</em>, but this feels like a dangerous misnomer. We must never
forget that we are interconnecting people, not things.</p>

<p>Any process of automation allows us to scale what we do by codifying
a process in some way that makes it efficient and repeatable. Machine
learning automates by emulating human (or other actions) found in data.
Machine learning codifies in the form of a mathematical function that is
learnt by a computer. If we can create these mathematical functions in
ways in which they can interconnect, then we can also build systems.</p>
<p>Machine learning works through codifying a prediction of interest
into a mathematical function. For example, we can try and predict the
probability that a customer wants to by a jersey given knowledge of
their age, and the latitude where they live. The technique known as
logistic regression estimates the odds that someone will by a jumper as
a linear weighted sum of the features of interest.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \text{odds} =
\frac{p(\text{bought})}{p(\text{not bought})} \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \log \text{odds}  = w_0 + w_1
\text{age} + w_2 \text{latitude}.\]</span> Here <span
class="math inline">\(w_0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(w_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(w_2\)</span> are the parameters of the model. If
<span class="math inline">\(w_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(w_2\)</span> are both positive, then the log-odds
that someone will buy a jumper increase with increasing latitude and
age, so the further north you are and the older you are the more likely
you are to buy a jumper. The parameter <span
class="math inline">\(w_0\)</span> is an offset parameter and gives the
log-odds of buying a jumper at zero age and on the equator. It is likely
to be negative<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> indicating that the purchase is
odds-against. This is also a classical statistical model, and models
like logistic regression are widely used to estimate probabilities from
ad-click prediction to disease risk.</p>
<p>This is called a generalized linear model, we can also think of it as
estimating the <em>probability</em> of a purchase as a nonlinear
function of the features (age, latitude) and the parameters (the <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> values). The function is known as the
<em>sigmoid</em> or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">logistic
function</a>, thus the name <em>logistic</em> regression.</p>

<p>The function has this characeristic ‘s’-shape (from where the term
sigmoid, as in sigma, comes from). It also takes the input from the
entire real line and ‘squashes’ it into an output that is between zero
and one. For this reason it is sometimes also called a ‘squashing
function’.</p>
<p>The sigmoid comes from the inverting the odds ratio, <span
class="math display">\[
\frac{\pi}{(1-\pi)}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> is the
probability of a positive outcome and <span
class="math inline">\(1-\pi\)</span> is the probability of a negative
outcome</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ p(\text{bought}) =  \sigma\left(w_0 +
w_1 \text{age} + w_2 \text{latitude}\right).\]</span></p>
<p>In the case where we have <em>features</em> to help us predict, we
sometimes denote such features as a vector, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ x}\)</span>, and we then use an inner
product between the features and the parameters, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ w}^\top \mathbf{ x}= w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 +
w_3 x_3 ...\)</span>, to represent the argument of the sigmoid.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ p(\text{bought})
=  \sigma\left(\mathbf{ w}^\top \mathbf{ x}\right).\]</span> More
generally, we aim to predict some aspect of our data, <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, by relating it through a mathematical
function, <span class="math inline">\(f(\cdot)\)</span>, to the
parameters, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ w}\)</span> and the
data, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ x}\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ y=  f\left(\mathbf{ x}, \mathbf{
w}\right).\]</span> We call <span
class="math inline">\(f(\cdot)\)</span> the <em>prediction
function</em>.</p>
<p>To obtain the fit to data, we use a separate function called the
<em>objective function</em> that gives us a mathematical representation
of the difference between our predictions and the real data.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E(\mathbf{ w}, \mathbf{Y},
\mathbf{X})\]</span> A commonly used examples (for example in a
regression problem) is least squares, <span
class="math display">\[E(\mathbf{ w}, \mathbf{Y}, \mathbf{X}) =
\sum_{i=1}^n\left(y_i - f(\mathbf{ x}_i, \mathbf{
w})\right)^2.\]</span></p>
<p>If a linear prediction function is combined with the least squares
objective function, then that gives us a classical <em>linear
regression</em>, another classical statistical model. Statistics often
focusses on linear models because it makes interpretation of the model
easier. Interpretation is key in statistics because the aim is normally
to validate questions by analysis of data. Machine learning has
typically focused more on the prediction function itself and worried
less about the interpretation of parameters. In statistics, where
interpretation is typically more important than prediction, parameters
are normally denoted by <span
class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\beta}\)</span> instead of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ w}\)</span>.</p>
<p>A key difference between statistics and machine learning, is that
(traditionally) machine learning has focussed on predictive capability
and statistics has focussed on interpretability. That means that in a
statistics class far more emphasis will be placed on interpretation of
the parameters. In machine learning, the parameters, $, are just a means
to an end. But in statistics, when we denote the parameters by <span
class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\beta}\)</span>, we often use the
parameters to tell us something about the disease.</p>
<p>So we move between <span class="math display">\[ p(\text{bought})
=  \sigma\left(w_0 + w_1 \text{age} + w_2
\text{latitude}\right).\]</span></p>
<p>to denote the emphasis is on predictive power to</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ p(\text{bought}) =  \sigma\left(\beta_0
+ \beta_1 \text{age} + \beta_2 \text{latitude}\right).\]</span></p>
<p>to denote the emphasis is on interpretation of the parameters.</p>
<p>Another effect of the focus on prediction in machine learning is that
<em>non-linear</em> approaches, which can be harder to interpret, are
more widely deployedin machine learning – they tend to improve quality
of predictions at the expense of interpretability.</p>

<p>A logistic regression is an approach to classification which extends
the linear basis function models we’ve already explored. Rather than
modeling the output of the function directly the assumption is that we
model the <em>log-odds</em> with the basis functions.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds">odds</a> are defined
as the ratio of the probability of a positive outcome, to the
probability of a negative outcome. If the probability of a positive
outcome is denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, then the
odds are computed as <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}\)</span>. Odds are widely used
by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker">bookmakers</a> in
gambling, although a bookmakers odds won’t normalise: i.e. if you look
at the equivalent probabilities, and sum over the probability of all
outcomes the bookmakers are considering, then you won’t get one. This is
how the bookmaker makes a profit. Because a probability is always
between zero and one, the odds are always between <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>. If the positive outcome is
unlikely the odds are close to zero, if it is very likely then the odds
become close to infinite. Taking the logarithm of the odds maps the odds
from the positive half space to being across the entire real line. Odds
that were between 0 and 1 (where the negative outcome was more likely)
are mapped to the range between <span
class="math inline">\(-\infty\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. Odds that are greater than 1 are
mapped to the range between <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>. Considering the log odds
therefore takes a number between 0 and 1 (the probability of positive
outcome) and maps it to the entire real line. The function that does
this is known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logit">logit
function</a>, <span class="math inline">\(g^{-1}(p_i) =
\log\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}\)</span>. This function is known as a <em>link
function</em>.</p>
<p>For a standard regression we take, <span class="math display">\[
f(\mathbf{ x}) = \mathbf{ w}^\top
\boldsymbol{ \phi}(\mathbf{ x}),
\]</span> if we want to perform classification we perform a logistic
regression. <span class="math display">\[
\log \frac{\pi}{(1-\pi)} = \mathbf{ w}^\top
\boldsymbol{ \phi}(\mathbf{ x})
\]</span> where the odds ratio between the positive class and the
negative class is given by <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\pi}{(1-\pi)}
\]</span> The odds can never be negative, but can take any value from 0
to <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>. We have defined the link
function as taking the form <span
class="math inline">\(g^{-1}(\cdot)\)</span> implying that the inverse
link function is given by <span class="math inline">\(g(\cdot)\)</span>.
Since we have defined, <span class="math display">\[
g^{-1}(\pi) =
\mathbf{ w}^\top \boldsymbol{ \phi}(\mathbf{ x})
\]</span> we can write <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> in terms
of the <em>inverse link</em> function, <span
class="math inline">\(g(\cdot)\)</span> as <span class="math display">\[
\pi = g(\mathbf{ w}^\top
\boldsymbol{ \phi}(\mathbf{ x})).
\]</span></p>
<h2 id="basis-function">Basis Function</h2>
<p>We’ll define our prediction, objective and gradient functions below.
But before we start, we need to define a basis function for our model.
Let’s start with the linear basis.</p>

<p>This inverse of the link function is known as the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function">logistic</a> (thus
the name logistic regression) or sometimes it is called the sigmoid
function. For a particular value of the input to the link function,
<span class="math inline">\(f_i = \mathbf{ w}^\top \boldsymbol{
\phi}(\mathbf{ x}_i)\)</span> we can plot the value of the inverse link
function as below.</p>
<p>By replacing the inverse link with the sigmoid we can write <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> as a function of the input and the
parameter vector as, <span class="math display">\[
\pi(\mathbf{ x},\mathbf{ w}) = \frac{1}{1+\exp\left(-\mathbf{ w}^\top
\boldsymbol{ \phi}(\mathbf{ x})\right)}.
\]</span> The process for logistic regression is as follows. Compute the
output of a standard linear basis function composition (<span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ w}^\top \boldsymbol{ \phi}(\mathbf{
x})\)</span>, as we did for linear regression) and then apply the
inverse link function, <span class="math inline">\(g(\mathbf{ w}^\top
\boldsymbol{ \phi}(\mathbf{ x}))\)</span>. In logistic regression this
involves <em>squashing</em> it with the logistic (or sigmoid) function.
Use this value, which now has an interpretation as a
<em>probability</em> in a Bernoulli distribution to form the likelihood.
Then we can assume conditional independence of each data point given the
parameters and develop a likelihod for the entire data set.</p>
<p>As we discussed last time, the Bernoulli likelihood is of the form,
<span class="math display">\[
P(y_i|\mathbf{ w}, \mathbf{ x}) =
\pi_i^{y_i} (1-\pi_i)^{1-y_i}
\]</span> which we can think of as clever trick for mathematically
switching between two probabilities if we were to write it as code it

<p>but writing it mathematically makes it easier to write our objective
function within a single mathematical equation.</p>
<h2 id="maximum-likelihood">Maximum Likelihood</h2>
<p>To obtain the parameters of the model, we need to maximize the
likelihood, or minimize the objective function, normally taken to be the
negative log likelihood. With a data conditional independence assumption
the likelihood has the form, <span class="math display">\[
P(\mathbf{ y}|\mathbf{ w},
\mathbf{X}) = \prod_{i=1}^nP(y_i|\mathbf{ w}, \mathbf{ x}_i).
\]</span> which can be written as a log likelihood in the form <span
class="math display">\[
\log P(\mathbf{ y}|\mathbf{ w},
\mathbf{X}) = \sum_{i=1}^n\log P(y_i|\mathbf{ w}, \mathbf{ x}_i) =
\sum_{i=1}^n
y_i \log \pi_i + \sum_{i=1}^n(1-y_i)\log (1-\pi_i)
\]</span> and if we take the probability of positive outcome for the
<span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th data point to be given by <span
class="math display">\[
\pi_i = g\left(\mathbf{ w}^\top \boldsymbol{ \phi}(\mathbf{
x}_i)\right),
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(g(\cdot)\)</span> is the
<em>inverse</em> link function, then this leads to an objective function
of the form, <span class="math display">\[
E(\mathbf{ w}) = -  \sum_{i=1}^ny_i \log
g\left(\mathbf{ w}^\top \boldsymbol{ \phi}(\mathbf{ x}_i)\right) -
\sum_{i=1}^n(1-y_i)\log \left(1-g\left(\mathbf{ w}^\top

<p>As normal, we would like to minimize this objective. This can be done
by differentiating with respect to the parameters of our prediction
function, <span class="math inline">\(\pi(\mathbf{ x};\mathbf{
w})\)</span>, for optimisation. The gradient of the likelihood with
respect to <span class="math inline">\(\pi(\mathbf{ x};\mathbf{
w})\)</span> is of the form, <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\text{d}E(\mathbf{ w})}{\text{d}\mathbf{ w}} = -\sum_{i=1}^n
\frac{y_i}{g\left(\mathbf{ w}^\top
\boldsymbol{ \phi}(\mathbf{
x})\right)}\frac{\text{d}g(f_i)}{\text{d}f_i}
\boldsymbol{ \phi}(\mathbf{ x}_i) +  \sum_{i=1}^n
\frac{1-y_i}{1-g\left(\mathbf{ w}^\top
\boldsymbol{ \phi}(\mathbf{
x})\right)}\frac{\text{d}g(f_i)}{\text{d}f_i}
\boldsymbol{ \phi}(\mathbf{ x}_i)
\]</span> where we used the chain rule to develop the derivative in
terms of <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{\text{d}g(f_i)}{\text{d}f_i}\)</span>, which
is the gradient of the inverse link function (in our case the gradient
of the sigmoid function).</p>
<p>So the objective function now depends on the gradient of the inverse
link function, as well as the likelihood depends on the gradient of the
inverse link function, as well as the gradient of the log likelihood,
and naturally the gradient of the argument of the inverse link function
with respect to the parameters, which is simply <span
class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{ \phi}(\mathbf{ x}_i)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The only missing term is the gradient of the inverse link function.
For the sigmoid squashing function we have, <span
class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
g(f_i) &amp;= \frac{1}{1+\exp(-f_i)}\\
&amp;=(1+\exp(-f_i))^{-1}
\end{align*}\]</span> and the gradient can be computed as <span
class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\frac{\text{d}g(f_i)}{\text{d} f_i} &amp; =
\exp(-f_i)(1+\exp(-f_i))^{-2}\\
&amp; = \frac{1}{1+\exp(-f_i)}
\frac{\exp(-f_i)}{1+\exp(-f_i)} \\
&amp; = g(f_i) (1-g(f_i))
\end{align*}\]</span> so the full gradient can be written down as <span
class="math display">\[
\frac{\text{d}E(\mathbf{ w})}{\text{d}\mathbf{ w}} = -\sum_{i=1}^n
y_i\left(1-g\left(\mathbf{ w}^\top \boldsymbol{ \phi}(\mathbf{
x})\right)\right)
\boldsymbol{ \phi}(\mathbf{ x}_i) +  \sum_{i=1}^n
(1-y_i)\left(g\left(\mathbf{ w}^\top \boldsymbol{ \phi}(\mathbf{
x})\right)\right)
\boldsymbol{ \phi}(\mathbf{ x}_i).

<p>As an example of using Gaussian process models within the full
pipeline from data to decsion, we’ll consider the prediction of Malaria
incidence in Uganda. For the purposes of this study malaria reports come
in two forms, HMIS reports from health centres and Sentinel data, which
is curated by the WHO. There are limited sentinel sites and many HMIS
sites.</p>
<p>The work is from Ricardo Andrade Pacheco’s PhD thesis, completed in
collaboration with John Quinn and Martin Mubangizi <span
class="citation"
data-cites="Andrade:consistent14 Mubangizi:malaria14">(Andrade-Pacheco
et al., 2014; Mubangizi et al., 2014)</span>. John and Martin were
initally from the AI-DEV group from the University of Makerere in
Kampala and more latterly they were based at UN Global Pulse in Kampala.

<p>Malaria data is spatial data. Uganda is split into districts, and
health reports can be found for each district. This suggests that models
such as conditional random fields could be used for spatial modelling,
but there are two complexities with this. First of all, occasionally
districts split into two. Secondly, sentinel sites are a specific
location within a district, such as Nagongera which is a sentinel site
based in the Tororo district.</p>

<p>Health monitoring system for the Kabarole district. Here we have
fitted the reports with a Gaussian process with an additive covariance
function. It has two components, one is a long time scale component (in
red above) the other is a short time scale component (in blue).</p>
<p>Monitoring proceeds by considering two aspects of the curve. Is the
blue line (the short term report signal) above the red (which represents
the long term trend? If so we have higher than expected reports. If this
is the case <em>and</em> the gradient is still positive (i.e. reports
are going up) we encode this with a <em>red</em> color. If it is the
case and the gradient of the blue line is negative (i.e. reports are
going down) we encode this with an <em>amber</em> color. Conversely, if
the blue line is below the red <em>and</em> decreasing, we color
<em>green</em>. On the other hand if it is below red but increasing, we
color <em>yellow</em>.</p>
<p>This gives us an early warning system for disease. Red is a bad
situation getting worse, amber is bad, but improving. Green is good and
getting better and yellow good but degrading.</p>

the effect is small.</p>

<p>Classical statistical models and simple machine learning models have
a great deal in common. The main difference between the fields is
philosophical. Machine learning practitioners are typically more
concerned with the quality of prediciton (e.g. measured by ROC curve)
while statisticians tend to focus more on the interpretability of the
model and the validity of any decisions drawn from that interpretation.
For example, a statistical model may be used to validate whether a large
scale intervention (such as the mass provision of mosquito nets) has had
a long term effect on disease (such as malaria). In this case one of the
covariates is likely to be the provision level of nets in a particular
region. The response variable would be the rate of malaria disease in
the region. The parmaeter, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>
associated with that covariate will demonstrate a positive or negative
effect which would be validated in answering the question. The focus in
statistics would be less on the accuracy of the response variable and
more on the validity of the interpretation of the effect variable, <span
class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>.</p>
<p>A machine learning practitioner on the other hand would typically
denote the parameter <span class="math inline">\(w_1\)</span>, instead
of <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> and would only be
interested in the output of the prediction function, <span
class="math inline">\(f(\cdot)\)</span> rather than the parameter
itself. The general formalism of the prediction function allows for
<em>non-linear</em> models. In machine learning, the emphasis on
prediction over interpretability means that non-linear models are often
used. The parameters, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{w}\)</span>,
are a means to an end (good prediction) rather than an end in themselves
(interpretable).</p>

<p>Figure: Deep learning models are composition of simple functions. We
can think of a pinball machine as an analogy. Each layer of pins
corresponds to one of the layers of functions in the model. Input data
is represented by the location of the ball from left to right when it is
dropped in from the top. Output class comes from the position of the
ball as it leaves the pins at the bottom.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Sometimes deep learning models are described as being like the brain,
or too complex to understand, but one analogy I find useful to help the
gist of these models is to think of them as being similar to early pin
ball machines.</p>
<p>In a deep neural network, we input a number (or numbers), whereas in
pinball, we input a ball.</p>
<p>Think of the location of the ball on the left-right axis as a single
number. Our simple pinball machine can only take one number at a time.
As the ball falls through the machine, each layer of pins can be thought
of as a different layer of ‘neurons’. Each layer acts to move the ball
from left to right.</p>
<p>In a pinball machine, when the ball gets to the bottom it might fall
into a hole defining a score, in a neural network, that is equivalent to
the decision: a classification of the input object.</p>
<p>An image has more than one number associated with it, so it is like
playing pinball in a <em>hyper-space</em>.</p>

<p>Learning involves moving all the pins to be in the correct position,
so that the ball ends up in the right place when it’s fallen through the
machine. But moving all these pins in hyperspace can be difficult.</p>
<p>In a hyper-space you have to put a lot of data through the machine
for to explore the positions of all the pins. Even when you feed many
millions of data points through the machine, there are likely to be
regions in the hyper-space where no ball has passed. When future test
data passes through the machine in a new route unusual things can
happen.</p>
<p><em>Adversarial examples</em> exploit this high dimensional space. If
you have access to the pinball machine, you can use gradient methods to
find a position for the ball in the hyper space where the image looks
like one thing, but will be classified as another.</p>
<p>Probabilistic methods explore more of the space by considering a
range of possible paths for the ball through the machine. This helps to
make them more data efficient and gives some robustness to adversarial
examples.</p>

is that both the target and the gun platform are moving. The challenge
was tackled using analogue computers, for example in the US the <a

<p>Like many challenges we face today, in the second world war, fire
control was handled by a hybrid system of humans and computers. This
means deploying human beings for the tasks that they can manage, and
machines for the tasks that are better performed by a machine. This
leads to a division of labour between the machine and the human that can
still be found in our modern digital ecosystems.</p>

<p>Donald MacKay was at King’s College for his PhD. He was just down the
road from Bill Phillips at LSE who was building the MONIAC. He was part
of the Ratio Club. A group of early career scientists who were
interested in communication and control in animals and humans, or more
specifically they were interested in computers and brains. The were part
of an international movement known as cybernetics.</p>
<p>Donald MacKay wrote of the influence that his own work on radar had
on his interest in the brain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… during the war I had worked on the theory of automated and
electronic computing and on the theory of information, all of which are
highly relevant to such things as automatic pilots and automatic gun
direction. I found myself grappling with problems in the design of
artificial sense organs for naval gun-directors and with the principles
on which electronic circuits could be used to simulate situations in the
external world so as to provide goal-directed guidance for ships,
aircraft, missiles and the like.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Later in the 1940’s, when I was doing my Ph.D. work, there was much
talk of the brain as a computer and of the early digital computers that
were just making the headlines as “electronic brains.” As an analogue
computer man I felt strongly convinced that the brain, whatever it was,
was not a digital computer. I didn’t think it was an analogue computer
either in the conventional sense.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But this naturally rubbed under my skin the question: well, if it is
not either of these, what kind of system is it? Is there any way of
following through the kind of analysis that is appropriate to their
artificial automata so as to understand better the kind of system the
human brain is? That was the beginning of my slippery slope into brain
research.</p>
<p><em>Behind the Eye</em> pg 40. Edited version of the 1986 Gifford
Lectures given by Donald M. MacKay and edited by Valerie MacKay</p>

316.</p>
<p>Importantly, MacKay distinguishes between the <em>analogue</em>
computer and the <em>digital</em> computer. As he mentions, his
experience was with analogue machines. An analogue machine is
<em>literally</em> an analogue. The radar systems that Wiener and MacKay
both worked on were made up of electronic components such as resistors,
capacitors, inductors and/or mechanical components such as cams and
gears. Together these components could represent a physical system, such
as an anti-aircraft gun and a plane. The design of the analogue computer
required the engineer to simulate the real world in analogue
electronics, using dualities that exist between e.g. mechanical circuits
(mass, spring, damper) and electronic circuits (inductor, resistor,
capacitor). The analogy between mass and a damper, between spring and a
resistor and between capacitor and a damper works because the underlying
mathematics is approximated with the same linear system: a second order
differential equation. This mathematical analogy allowed the designer to
map from the real world, through mathematics, to a virtual world where
the components reflected the real world through analogy.</p>

<p>The machine learning systems we have built today that can reconstruct
human text, or human classification of images, necessarily must have
some aspects to them that are analagous to our understanding. As MacKay
suggests the brain is neither a digital or an analogue computer, and the
same can be said of the modern neural network systems that are being
tagged as “artificial intelligence”.</p>
<p>I believe a better term for them is “human-analogue machines”,
because what we have built is not a system that can make intelligent
decisions from first principles (a rational approach) but one that
observes how humans have made decisions through our data and
reconstructs that process. Machine learning is more empiricist than
rational, but now we n empirical approach that distils our evolved
intelligence.</p>

<p>Figure: Jonathan Zittrain’s term to describe the challenges of
explanation that come with AI is Intellectual Debt.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the context of machine learning and complex systems, Jonathan
Zittrain has coined the term <a
href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/from-technical-debt-to-intellectual-debt-in-ai-e05ac56a502c">“Intellectual
Debt”</a> to describe the challenge of understanding what you’ve
created. In <a
href="https://mlatcl.github.io/projects/data-oriented-architectures-for-ai-based-systems.html">the
ML@CL group we’ve been foucssing on developing the notion of a
<em>data-oriented architecture</em></a> to deal with intellectual debt
<span class="citation" data-cites="Cabrera-realworld23">(Cabrera et al.,
2023)</span>.</p>
<p>Zittrain points out the challenge around the lack of interpretability
of individual ML models as the origin of intellectual debt. In machine
learning I refer to work in this area as fairness, interpretability and
transparency or FIT models. To an extent I agree with Zittrain, but if
we understand the context and purpose of the decision making, I believe
this is readily put right by the correct monitoring and retraining
regime around the model. A concept I refer to as “progression testing”.
Indeed, the best teams do this at the moment, and their failure to do it
feels more of a matter of technical debt rather than intellectual,
because arguably it is a maintenance task rather than an explanation
task. After all, we have good statistical tools for interpreting
individual models and decisions when we have the context. We can
linearise around the operating point, we can perform counterfactual
tests on the model. We can build empirical validation sets that explore
fairness or accuracy of the model.</p>

(2024)</span> intellectual debt p. 84, 85, 349, 365.</p>
<p>But if we can avoid the pitfalls of counterfeit people, this also
offers us an opportunity to <em>psychologically represent</em> <span
class="citation"
data-cites="Heider:interpersonal58">(<strong>Heider:interpersonal58?</strong>)</span>
the machine in a manner where humans can communicate without special
training. This in turn offers the opportunity to overcome the challenge
of <em>intellectual debt</em>.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of interpretability of machine learning models, they
allow us access to what the machine is doing in a way that bypasses many
of the traditional techniques developed in statistics. But understanding
this new route for access is a major new challenge.</p>

<p>In a classic study <span class="citation"
data-cites="Simons-gorillas99">Simons and Chabris (1999)</span> ask
subjects to count the number of passes of the basketball between players
on the team wearing white shirts. Fifty percent of the time, these
subjects don’t notice the gorilla moving across the scene.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of inattentional blindness is well known, e.g in their
paper Simons and Charbris quote the Hungarian neurologist, Rezsö
Bálint,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a well-known phenomenon that we do not notice anything
happening in our surroundings while being absorbed in the inspection of
something; focusing our attention on a certain object may happen to such
an extent that we cannot perceive other objects placed in the peripheral
parts of our visual field, although the light rays they emit arrive
completely at the visual sphere of the cerebral cortex.</p>
<p>Rezsö Bálint 1907 (translated in Husain and Stein 1988, page 91)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we combine the complexity of the world with our relatively low
bandwidth for information, problems can arise. Our focus on what we
perceive to be the most important problem can cause us to miss other
(potentially vital) contextual information.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is known as selective attention or ‘inattentional
blindness’.</p>

from Herman Hesse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“ ‘When someone seeks,’ said Siddhartha, ‘then it easily happens that
his eyes see only the thing that he seeks, and he is able to find
nothing, to take in nothing. […] Seeking means: having a goal. But
finding means: being free, being open, having no goal.’ ”</p>
<p>Hermann Hesse</p>

<p>Their idea is that having a hypothesis can constrain our thinking.
However, in answer to their paper <span class="citation"

form of hypothesis is always necessary, suggesting that a hypothesis

<p>In today’s lecture we’ve drilled down further on a difficult aspect
of data science. By focusing too much on the data and the technical
challenges we face, we can forget the context. But to do data science
well, we must not forget the context of the data. We need to pay
attention to domain experts and introduce their understanding to our
analysis. Above all we must not forget that data is almost always (in
the end) about people.</p>

# Delve





include{_delve/includes/delve-report-list.md}

There is lots of hope for the role data science and AI could play, but we’re still a way off from being AI-ready. Further attention is needed on some of the foundational issues around data use – access, skills, culture – before we can begin to talk in earnest about deploying AI. [link here to data readiness]

include{_delve/includes/data-report-recommendations.md}

Delivering a rapid response requires the ability to quickly convene teams from across disciplines (and often institutions) around a key question. To facilitate this, we also used ideas from blog post on [open data science](http://inverseprobability.com/2014/07/01/open-data-science). to facilitate communication and understanding.

We separated the challenges we face into three groups: (1) paradoxes of the odern data society, (2) quantifying the value of data and (3) privacy loss of control and marginalization. We've noted the origins of the paradoxes, speculating that it is based in a form of data (or modelling) inattention bias demonstrated through the Gorilla. We've drawn parallels between challenges of rewarding the addition of value and the credit assignment problem in reinforecement learning and we've looked at approaches to introduce the voice of marginalized societies and people into the conversation.

## Conclusions







The particular circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic have highlighted the challenges of integrating scientific ideas to answer policy questions. In this talk, we've given a formal introduction to the problem, the difficulty of communicating between individuals (particularly from different domains) and reviewed the ideas and solutions we used in the Delve initiative.

Recommendations from the DELVE Data report suggest that more effort needs to be placed into working in this manner in normal circumstances, so that when an emergency occurs we are better prepared to deal with the questions we face. Other approaches prosed include data trusts.

When we combine these difficult challenges with complex models, we need to put more effort into decomposing our models so that they may be calibrated and re-integrated at appropriate fidelities.
