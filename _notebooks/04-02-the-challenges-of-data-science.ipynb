    "somewhat difference from classical software engineering.\n",

    "introduce this code into your production system at all. But what if your\n",
    "manager told you to do so, how would you go about incorporating this\n",
    "code base?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is *very* carefully. You would have to engage in a process\n",
    "more akin to debugging than regular software engineering. As you\n",
    "understood the code base, for your work to be reproducible, you should\n",
    "be documenting it, not just what you discovered, but how you discovered\n",
    "it. In the end, you typically find a single API call that is the one\n",
    "that most benefits your system. But more thought has been placed into\n",
    "this line of code than any line of code you have written before.\n",
    "\n",
    "An enormous amount of debugging would be required. As the nature of the\n",

    "write to interact with the software on the USB stick are likely to be\n",
    "minimal. But more thought would be put into those lines than perhaps any\n",
    "other lines of code in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even then, when your API code is introduced into your production system,\n",

    "1.  When you begin an analysis, behave as a debugger.\n",

    "-   Write test code as you go. Document those tests and ensure they are\n",

    "-   Understand the landscape of your data. Be prepared to try several\n",
    "    different approaches to the data set.\n",

    "-   Use the best tools available, develop a deep understand how they\n",
    "    work.\n",
    "-   Share your experience of what challenges you’re facing. Have others\n",
    "    (software engineers, fellow data analysts, your manager) review your\n",
    "    work.\n",
    "-   Never go straight for the goal: you’d never try and write the API\n",
    "    call straight away on the discarded hard drive, so why are you\n",
    "    launching your classification algorithm before visualizing the data?\n",
    "-   Ensure your analysis is documented and accessible. If your code does\n",
    "    go wrong in production, you’ll need to be able to retrace to where\n",
    "    the error crept in.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  When managing the data science process, don’t treat it as standard\n",
    "    code development.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Don’t deploy a traditional agile development pipeline and expect it\n",
    "    to work the same way it does for standard code development. Think\n",
    "    about how you handle bugs, think about how you would handle very\n",
    "    many bugs.\n",
    "-   Don’t leave the data scientist alone to wade through the mess.\n",
    "-   Integrate the data analysis with your other team activities. Have\n",
    "    the software engineers and domain experts work closely with the data\n",
    "    scientists. This is vital for providing the data scientists with the\n",
    "    technical support they need, but also managing the expectations of\n",
    "    the engineers in terms of when and how the data will be able to\n",
    "    deliver.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation**: Anecdotally, resolving a machine learning challenge\n",
    "requires 80% of the resource to be focused on the data and perhaps 20%\n",
    "to be focused on the model. But many companies are too keen to employ\n",

    "transfer learning, or it can merely be our beliefs about the\n",
    "regularities of the universe. In humans our models include our inductive\n",
